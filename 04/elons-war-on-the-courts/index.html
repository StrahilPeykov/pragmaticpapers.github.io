      Musk and Trump are stress-testing nearly every federal institution, but
      the courts are checking them left and right. Just this week the courts
      told DOGE they can’t access

      well-worn paths that haven’t been fruitful in the past.

    <p>
      While Trump has spent years railing against the courts, now Elon is
      echoing the same line—claiming we’re in the middle of a coup. Not from
      <em>them</em>, of course—from the judges who keep telling them "no." Now
      Elon is using his money to pry open other doors. He is like a spoiled kid
      mad at the parent who told him no. If judges are the “mom” holding firm,
      Congress is “dad” and Elon is turning on the charm. In response to the
      courts’ stonewalling this week, he sent a message by donating the maximum
      allowable amount to any
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/musk-donations-congress-judges.html?smid=url-share"
        >congress member openly condemning the courts’ orders</a
      >. Not willing to toe the line? Musk will fund a primary challenge to
      <a
        href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133777-elon-musk-threatens-republican-senators/"
        >replace you with someone who will</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elon is taking many different routes to support Trump. During the
      election, he put
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-rbg-pac-abortion-349e66f50b2cd08f6bcebed56f941a3e"
        >20 million into the ironically named RBG PAC</a
      >, whose sole purpose was to run ads trying to moderate Trump’s stance on
      abortion by making it appear as though his view aligned with the late Ruth
      Bader Ginsburg – laughable, considering his SCOTUS picks helped overturn
      Roe v. Wade. He is
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-donald-trump-doge-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine-harris-russia-45d6cc8f7d51c57602b66141e870a882"
        >running ads in DC</a
      >
      touting his and Trump’s accomplishments thus far, and reportedly is
      working to
      <a
        href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/12/musk-trump-100-million-donation-political-operation"
        >donate another 100 million</a
      >
      to Trump’s political operation in continued efforts to cement his power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another area where Elon is weighing in is his effort to
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-340b-program-3f39eeab89fa352d77c6be4701d7f323"
        >stop a program called 340B</a
      >, which requires drug companies to give discounts to hospitals that care
      for uninsured and low-income patients. The group Elon is funding that is
      backing the ads, called Building America, is targeting local Republicans,
      claiming the money is used in transgender care. Why? The Republicans named
      in the ads have no idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elon is also in Texas,
      <a
        href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/08/elon-musk-texans-for-lawsuit-reform-campaign-donation/"
        >donating to the Texans for Lawsuit Reform</a
      >, a group that focuses on making it harder to sue businesses. I imagine
      this will be very useful when he finally makes good on his promise to move
      his companies out of California and into Texas.

      who would replace a retiring liberal judge on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
      Tesla is currently suing the state over its law banning car manufacturers
      from running car dealerships and, wouldn’t you know, the candidate, Brad
      Schimel, refuses to say if he will recuse himself if the case makes it to
      him, should he win a place on the court.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elon is also taking his show international by endorsing far right
      candidates in Argentina, Germany, the UK, and Canada. The results have
      been mixed to say the least. Javier Milei of Argentina won his election.
      Germany’s AfD got a bump, but not the win, and the other parties are now
      refusing to form a government with them. In the UK, they are working to

        >limit Musk’s ability to donate to the far right Reform UK</a
      >
      to hedge his influence there. In Canada, he has no hope. Thanks to all the
      annexation talk, anything Pro-Trump is going to shit,

        href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11093349/wayne-gretzky-statue-vandalism/"
        >literally</a
      >. The conservatives there have had to change their tune to being very
      anti-Trump, and there is a petition by the citizens to

        >revoke Musk’s citizenship</a
      >. Even in the US, Elon’s reputation has been taking a nosedive. He may
      have inspired Robert Downing Jr’s Iron Man character in the Marvel movies
      once upon a time, but now, his Tesla dealerships are getting targeted for
      property damage, Nazi symbols, and the sales are tanking.

    <p>
      Now, let's take a step back. How much does money really matter? In 2024,
      the Dems spent 500 million more than the Republicans in the presidential
      race and <em>still lost</em>. Same as in 2016. Dems have outraised
      Republicans in every
      <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/raising-bythenumbers/"
        >presidential race since 2004</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      An awkwardly revealing
      <a
        href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31481/w31481.pdf"
        >study was done on the impact of Citizens United</a
      >. On a state level, 23 states had their bans on campaign finance lifted,
      while for the other 27 states, it was business as usual. Those 27 states
      provided a sort of control for researchers to measure the effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The results were not what most expect. The 23 states that had the ban on
      campaign finance lifted ended up with more incumbents being outvoted, even
      though incumbents were more likely to benefit from extra donations. This
      didn’t just hurt Dems! Both sides were more likely to have their
      incumbents booted. Why? Those 23 states also saw more political activity
      from groups that traditionally sat out. The ban added more players to the
      game. Legislatures also became <em>less polarized</em>. It's like both
      sides have rich people!

    <p>
      The biggest impact from Citizens United was on economic activity. More
      money means more ads, more consultants, and more seasonal hiring. We have
      even seen
      <a href="https://wiki.destiny.gg/view/DGG_canvassing_history"
        >our friendly neighborhood Omniliberal</a
      >
      throw some money into the game. Election season has turned into an
      economic stimulus. (Note: This data only goes up to 2016. Sure would be
      nice to see an update.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dems are flailing, and honestly? So is everyone else. The courts are
      our firewall protecting us from complete meltdown, but they are just
      buying us some time. They can’t fix the problem. And money isn’t the
      answer– it’s a tool, and here, it’s just doing what it always does, which
      is make more of what we already have. And the fire it’s feeding is getting
      hot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elon is lobbing bombs across state lines and the world, stress testing
      every system, probing for the weak spots. The irony? He is trying to burn
      the systems that protect him too. The same systems that allow him to pour
      billions into our elections are the same ones that keep the pitchforks
      from his door– including the Tesla dealerships

    <p>
      If Elon breaks the government too much, he might find himself in a world
      that can’t protect him either. When you set the house on fire, you don’t
      get to choose which room burns, and try as he might, this is the only
      house we’ve got. Let’s be real—Mars isn’t taking guests.
