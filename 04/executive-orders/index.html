    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>14229 – Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-10/pdf/2025-03869.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 4, 2025, published March 10, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 lays out that since a single child, named Jocelyn Nungaray, was
      murdered on June 17, 2024 by two Venezuelans who were undocumented and
      allegedly<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> members of the Tren de
      Aragua gang, they should rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge to
      the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 is the actual order to rename the refuge under the National
      Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      The plan reading of this text is enough to understand its tangible
      effects. The refuge has been renamed.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This refuge, a small wetland to the east of Houston, Texas, has little
      relevance to the death of Jocelyn Nungaray. She lived in Houston, and
      allegedly loved nature. However, Donald Trump’s attempt at immortalizing
      her with the name change, is a far more narcissistic and selfish move than
      it appears on its face. During his campaign, Donald Trump was fond of
      waiving about her death to scare Americans about undocumented migrants. I
      will not comment on the circumstances of her death or her murderers,
      though an article with a summary is included for
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/what-we-know-houston-jocelyn-nungaray-killing/index.html"
        >reference</a
      >. There is little more to say about this EO other than Donald Trump has
      now not only used the poor victim’s name for his own gain, but now has
      forever associated her with his corrupt administration.

    <h3>14230 – Addressing Risks From Perkins Coie LLP</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-11/pdf/2025-03989.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 6, 2025, published March 11, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 reads like a really petty burn book entry about Perkins Coie
      LLP, a law firm that has worked with political candidates and in lawsuits
      against the government. It connects them to Hillary Clinton, an unfounded
      conspiracy regarding election fraud, and George Soros. It mentions, but
      fails to cite, a case in which Perkins Coie attorneys were sanctioned for
      an unethical lack of candor. It calls out a diversity initiative of the
      firm for being racist. It then uses this claim of bigotry to say that the
      firm has ceded all right to have any security clearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 then directs the DNI and other relevant departments to withdraw
      any security credentials of Perkins Coie. It then directs all agencies to
      cease any possible benefit given to Perkins Coie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 reiterates that the firm is bigoted and assisted in election
      fraud and therefore directs that all agencies terminate any contracts with
      Perkins Coie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 directs the EEOC to target Perkins Coie for unfair business
      practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 bars Perkins Coie employees from entering federal buildings and
      bars the hiring of Perkins Coie employees.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      Breaking the EO into parts, it is quite a mess of insults and attacks on
      Perkins Coie. While the government is not required to work with any
      particular law firm, and may choose who it employs, but this EO is far
      beyond such a simple decision. The removal of security clearances in such
      a sweeping motion is unconventional, as is the explicit direction to the
      EEOC to target the firm for unfair business practices. The barring of
      Perkins Coie employees from federal buildings likely will not survive a
      hearing. The allegations of racism could form the basis of a claim of
      defamation, though whether the firm will bring this claim is not likely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taken holistically, the EO clearly is a targeted attack at a firm that was
      working against Trump’s interests. Trump’s allegations are the most
      perverse twisting of reality, in order to gloss over the naked aggression
      he is presenting against Perkins Coie. There was no unethical or illegal
      behavior while representing Hillary Clinton in 2016. Their involvement
      with the Steele Dossier also was neither unethical nor particularly unique
      as far as opposition research. Any representation of Satan’s direct
      incarnation, George Soros, was neither unique nor in some way resulting in
      unlawful overturning of laws, voter registration related or otherwise.
      While ethics violations are nothing to be scoffed at, at a firm the size
      of Perkins Coie one of their many attorneys being sanctioned is not
      uncommon nor surprising.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      Perkins Coie have already filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of this
      EO. The barring of Perkins Coie employees from federal property is almost
      certain to be overturned. Defamation and breach of contract are likely
      other claims that they could be successful with. This is of course little
      comfort, as it is clear the Administration will be used in any way
      possible to harass and harm this law firm. The direction to the EEOC being
      so public, likely indicates a myriad of other actions taken by the
      government against Perkins Coie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins Coie is a capable and well managed firm, seeing how they and the
      judiciary react to this authoritarian and draconian will likely be a good
      template of what to do, or how brutal the Administration will be. If
      Perkins Coie is lucky, the US Government will get tired and move on, if
      not we might see just how willing Donald Trump is to twist his power to
      punish his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a personal level, I understand that attorneys as a group are not loved
      by the public, and do not make sympathetic victims. However, I am
      disturbed by this action, and the Administration’s actions against
      <a
        href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-targeted-20-biggest-law-092501746.html"
        >other firms</a
      >. Attacking a firm and officers of the court for performing their duties
      to their client is abhorrent, and should be condemned fully by the legal
      community. To see their statement and see updates of their ongoing case
      with the government, they have provided a statement and

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 tries to cover for the Administration having no spine and
      backing down from actually implementing the tariffs that they tried to
      implement against Canada.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 designates the goods under the terms of
      <a
        href="https://hts.usitc.gov/reststop/file?release=currentRelease&amp;filename=General%20Note%2011"
        >general note 11 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
        (HTSUS)</a
      >, including any treatment set forth in
      <a
        href="https://hts.usitc.gov/reststop/file?release=currentRelease&amp;filename=Chapter%2098"
        >chapter XXIII of chapter 98</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://hts.usitc.gov/reststop/file?release=currentRelease&amp;filename=Chapter%2099"
        >subchapter XXII of chapter 99</a
      >
      of HTSUS as related to the USMCA to not be subject to the additional
      duties under 2(a) or 2(b) of EO 14193. It also lowers the potash tariff
      from 25 to 10%.
    </p>

    <h4 id="14231wim">What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This is an uncharacteristically dense EO with changes to the sweeping
      tariffs the Administration initiated against Canada. Reading through the
      three links included in the paragraph above can make your eyes go crossed
      and leave you wondering what is even being changed. A guiding rule is that
      goods that are covered under the United States Mexico Canada Agreement
      (USCMA) are not subject to the 25% tariff imposed by the Administration.
      It also reduces the tariff of potash, an important component of
      fertilizer, from 25% to 10%.
    </p>

    <h4 id="14231lf">Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      As with most of the negotiations initiated by Donald Trump, the
      Administration is quickly trying to back down the country from
      implementing the policies that he comes up with off the cuff. This delay
      is likely being implemented in order to create space for a negotiation of
      a more favorable trade agreement for the US than the USMCA. This is a high
      goal, as the USMCA is largely to the United States’ favor, and crafted
      mostly by the prior Trump Administration. While I have studied the
      NAFTA<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
      and USMCA from a legal perspective, I will withhold any specific analysis
      of these treaties for a different article.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the first, nor will it likely be the last, time we see this
      Administration fail to follow through with a threat when met with the cold
      light of day and the red light of the stock market in response to the
      President’s reckless language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the tariffs resume as of April 2, 2025. There is little doubt that
      every corner of the American and Canadian economies will suffer greatly.
      Both economies, thanks to the NAFTA and USCMA, have become integrated such
      that neither is in any position to assume the specialties of the other.
      Currently there are highschool classes that have covered the concept of
      Comparative Advantage this semester. Hopefully one of their students will
      share their notes with the White House in time to prevent too much harm.

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 is equally as mewling and pathetic as the one in
      <a href="#14231">EO 14231</a>, but about Mexico.
    </p>

    <p>Section 2 is also a Mexican themed version of Section 2 in EO 14231.</p>

    <h3>
      14233 – Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States
      Digital Asset Stockpile
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-11/pdf/2025-03992.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 6, 2025, published March 11, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 gives a very poor explanation of what Bitcoin is. It also points
      out that the US government holds a significant amount of crypto due to
      civil forfeiture and taking assets of criminals.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 establishes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish an office to
      administer and maintain the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 requires all agency heads to provide an accounting of the
      digital assets under their agency’s control.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      The EO is, by itself, inoffensive and, in a vacuum, be something that
      would benefit the US Government. While a discussion of the value,
      viability, and use of digital assets are all up for debate, they are
      discussed neither in the EO<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> or
      this report. Regardless, the US Government is in possession of as much as
      $19 billion in digital assets,
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx0g1py5v0o">mostly bitcoin</a
      >. These digital assets, before this EO, were not held centrally nor with
      consistent record keeping. The Treasury department holding and maintaining
      them could be the right step for the US Government to protect its assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, whether proper procedures and safety measures will be
      taken, and whether proper recording methods will be observed, are yet to
      be seen. This EO in no way guarantees that such a reserve will be little
      more than a slush fund for the Administration, or a grand prize for
      enterprising hackers.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      My understanding of digital assets is only slightly above the average
      person’s and I will not attempt to discuss the benefits or detriments of
      them generally or individually. However, this strategic reserve does not
      require much understanding of digital assets to understand the issues that
      surround it.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, security of these digital assets is not clearly something within
      the capabilities of the Treasury or any ad hoc department they form to do
      so. Digital assets are notorious for their vulnerability to hackers and
      clandestine operations.

    <p>
      Second, there is no clear value to the nation for this strategic reserve.
      The strategic oil and bullion reserves are regarding commodities that have
      uses within the economy and can be used to help smooth spikes in these
      markets as well as protect the needs of the United States government for
      these commodities. There’s little clear use for digital assets held by the
      United States Government, other than to potentially sell and use the funds
      gained by doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third and most concerning, while there is no directive here for the
      Treasury to purchase digital assets, there is nothing preventing it from
      doing so at the Administration’s direction. Should the Administration
      impound funds from other departments, they could then use that money to
      buy digital assets. While there technically is an exchange of goods, and
      now the government has an asset, they are speculative and hold no real
      intrinsic value. This means that large holders of digital assets could
      offload them for real US dollars, and leave the crypto market entirely.
      This turns every digital asset into a potential rugpull, at the American
      taxpayer’s expense. There are few other actions throughout history that
      are so nakedly paying the wealthy directly from the government coffers.
      There should be no mistake, even if the language of this EO might speak to
      a digital reserve that could serve some purpose, the only likely outcome
      will be corruption with a shiny crypto sheen of paint.

    <h3>14234 – Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness</h3>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 gives a brief history of the PSLF Program. It then claims the
      Biden Administration abused the PSLF program. It talks about Donald
      Trump’s duties as the president, most unrelated to student loans, and how
      this EO is connected to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 then directs the Secretary of Education to revise the PSLF to
      prevent any potential beneficiary of the PSLF to receive loan forgiveness
      if they help undocumented migrants, terrorists, child abusers (trans
      health care), illegal discrimination (DEI), or violating state tort laws
      (protesting).
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      In an especially cruel move, the EO will prevent any person working in the
      government or approved non-profit under the PSLF program from receiving
      loan forgiveness if they work in a field that offends the Administration.
      The categories are broad enough that it will likely mean a significant
      number of people enrolled under PSLF will not receive loan forgiveness. If
      a doctor working in a hospital in a sanctuary city provides health care to
      an undocumented migrant, the employees of a government agency partook in a
      DEI program, a person who works for the government or non-profit protests
      outside of work, or a person says in a private conversation that trans
      children should receive healthcare, or a person stated that they believed
      that Palestinians deserve sympathy, they could be refused loan forgiveness
      due to this EO.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This in conjunction with the Administration’s shuttering of the Department
      of Education, it is likely that we are seeing attempts to preserve as many
      student loans as possible. Some have speculated that this is simply the
      Administration believing any forgiveness would be a loss. By keeping the
      loans, in their view, the US Government is retaining an asset and the
      income derived from it. Others have argued that the retaining of these
      loans is to at some point in the future off load them to a private owner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of the intent, the PSLF beneficiaries enrolled in the program
      under specific terms, and the unilateral changes made to those terms by
      the Administration likely cannot be applied to them. While the executive
      branch may take measures to prevent the forgiveness of these loans, it is
      possible that a court will rule that even if the forgiveness is not
      granted by the executive, the enrolled person is entitled to such
      forgiveness. Likely this would result in those people leaving their
      position, continuing to paying their monthly minimum, then once a new
      regime is elected who is favorable to student loans, sue for overpayments.
