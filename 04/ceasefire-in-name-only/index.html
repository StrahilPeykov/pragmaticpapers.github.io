      Following U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff’s
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6170w5jj5o">trip to Moscow</a>
      last Thursday, he told CNN on Monday that President Trump would be
      speaking with Putin sometime this week—a call
      <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-putin-will-speak-tuesday-about-the-war-in-ukraine">PBS</a>
      later confirmed would take place on Tuesday. We also got a bit more
      insight into Witkoff’s closed-door meeting with Putin—at least in terms of
      what was discussed. He confirmed that territory was part of the
      conversation, though he declined to say what that might mean for Ukraine’s
      future borders. Witkoff tried to reassure the public that Ukraine is being
      kept updated on every move, but whether that’s actually happening is still
      anyone’s guess.

      Trump and Putin held their long-awaited phone call Tuesday, which lasted
      around 90 minutes and resulted in what both sides are calling a temporary
      energy ceasefire.
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c3e4xzd8qq8t">Putin</a> supposedly
      agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days,
      while also laying out a familiar set of conditions for any broader peace
      deal—vague phrases like eliminating the “root causes” of the war, which we
      all know is Kremlin-speak for NATO guarantees and territorial concessions.
      <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-call-zelenskyy-nato-ceasefire-zaporizhzhia-rcna196847">Trump</a>
      celebrated the call as “productive,” and claimed on Truth Social that it
      marked the beginning of the end of the war. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy—who was
      once again not involved in the actual conversation—said he supports the
      energy ceasefire but made it clear Russia is still not serious about
      peace. On the battlefield, Ukraine continued pushing hard, launching a
      <a href="https://www.twz.com/land/russia-confirms-ongoing-ukrainian-assault-on-belgorod-region">new cross-border assault into Russia’s Belgorod region</a>, a reminder that while Western leaders talk, Ukraine is still very much
      interested in taking the fight to Russia.

      On Wednesday, President Zelenskyy finally spoke with Trump in what both
      called a “very good” and “substantive” hour long call. According to
      <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-zelenskyy-call-ukraine-russia-putin/">CBS News</a>, much of the conversation centered on aligning with Trump’s prior call
      with Putin, particularly around a partial energy ceasefire. Trump’s team
      claimed Zelenskyy was “fully briefed,” and even floated the bizarre idea
      that the U.S. could “take ownership” of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants to
      protect them. Zelenskyy, while supportive of steps toward peace, made it
      clear he remains skeptical, saying Putin’s words alone aren't enough and
      that Ukraine needs technical guarantees, not vague promises. As
      <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-speak-ukraines-zelenskyy-after-putin-rebuffs-30/story?id=119945704">ABC reported</a>, Ukrainian and American teams are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia to
      sort out the logistics of said deals. And in a welcome bit of good news,
      <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-prisoner-swap-53b8061fbbc68a397292c798366c5947">AP reported</a>
      that Ukraine and Russia carried out one of the largest prisoner swaps
      since the full-scale invasion began, with 175 soldiers returned on each
      side—and to top it off,
      <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-confirms-new-arrival-of-f-16-jets-in-ukraine/">Zelenskyy confirmed</a>
      that a fresh batch of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets has officially landed
      in Ukraine.

      Just hours after Trump publicly praised Putin’s supposed desire for peace,
      Russia unleashed one of its largest drone assaults in weeks—launching
      nearly 200 drones that left civilians wounded and homes burning across
      Ukraine’s Kirovohrad region. Zelenskyy posted images of the destruction,
      calling out the Kremlin’s continued aggression despite its “partial
      ceasefire” claims. Zelenskyy shared haunting images of the aftermath,
      declaring that
      <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-trump-ceasefire-putin-zelenskyy-photos-destruction-rcna197242">Russia’s attacks “do not stop”</a>. Ukraine’s air defenses shot down 75 of the drones, but the damage was
      already done. Meanwhile, Kyiv fired back hard, targeting Russia’s Engels
      airbase—deep inside Russian territory.
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-russia-airbase-engels-drones.html">The New York Times</a>
      confirmed that the strike had hit weapons storage areas and triggered
      secondary explosions, forcing Russian evacuations. As if that wasn’t
      enough, Putin signed a new
      <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-ukrainian-citizens-without-legal-status-to-leave-russia-occupied-territories-by-sept-10/">decree</a>
      ordering Ukrainian citizens without legal status in Russia and occupied
      territories to leave by September 10, further escalating his campaign to
      “Russify” illegally seized land. While the US seems set on playing both
      sides being ever unpredictable, the UK hosted senior NATO-aligned military
      leaders to discuss forming a Western-led peacekeeping force for Ukraine, a
      plan now moving into its operational phase, according to
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z1w1y2neo">BBC</a>.

    <p>
      On Friday, we continued to see what this so-called “partial ceasefire”
      really means—Russia is making it crystal clear. While Moscow claims to be
      refraining from strikes on energy infrastructure, it’s seemingly
      redirecting its firepower toward civilians instead.
      <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-drones-strike-ukrainian-city-odesa-underlining-challenges-120015538">Russian drones</a>
      hammered the Black Sea port city of Odesa, sparking massive fires and
      injuring civilians just hours before Czech President Petr Pavel arrived.
      In the southeast,
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/22/ukraine-war-briefing-two-people-killed-as-russia-pounds-zaporizhzhia">Zaporizhzhia</a>
      was hit more than ten times, killing two and injuring nine—including a
      nine-month-old infant. Ukraine’s air defenses intercepted much of the 200+
      drones launched, but civilian neighborhoods were still left smoldering.
      Meanwhile,
      <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-budget-committee-gives-green-light-3-bln-euros-ukraine-aid-2025-03-21/">Germany</a>
      approved €3 billion in long-delayed military aid, and the UK pledged to
      ramp up its military planning—including the possibility of boots on the
      ground—if a ceasefire deal ever actually materializes.
