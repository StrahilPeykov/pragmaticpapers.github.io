      On January 19th, 2025, Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire agreement.
      No sooner than the ink was dry, Donald Trump was on social media,
      <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250117074926/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/15/israel-war-gaza-ceasefire-hostages-news-hamas/#link-RO4YL25X2ZB6DJP3TWPCCUIFTE"
        >gloating about his role in the negotiations</a
      >. “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of
      our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that
      my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the
      safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump posted on Truth Social,
      his social media network. For a brief moment in time, it seemed somewhat
      well earned. Biden officials and diplomats alike
      <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/15/israel-war-gaza-ceasefire-hostages-news-hamas/#link-RO4YL25X2ZB6DJP3TWPCCUIFTE"
        >credited Steve Witkoff’s efforts</a
      >. In return for the release of 33 hostages,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Gaza_war_ceasefire"
        >Israel would release</a
      >
      1904 Palestinian security prisoners, exit portions of the Gaza strip, and
      allow “sufficient” humanitarian aid through. The start of a 3 phase plan,
      this was a welcomed step in the right direction. For an incredibly brief,
      miniscule amount of time, it looked like Donald Trump had got a big win
      before taking over.

      Like most things Donald Trump attempts to sell, further inspection
      revealed significant faults. First,
      <a
        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/israel-far-right-gaza-settler-movement-cmd-intl/index.html"
        >some of the most powerful political parties in Israel</a
      >
      actively wanted the war to continue. Sure enough, the day the ceasefire
      was signed,
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/itamar-bengvir-resigns-gaza-ceasefire-netanyahu-d63bc4ac1e4f741cafa6fab4d932f891"
        >Itamar Ben-Gvir</a
      >
      quit his post in Netanyahu’s cabinet. If more resignations were to come,
      <a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/religious-zionism-says-will-quit-coalition-if-no-return-to-war-after-deals-1st-phase/"
        >as they were threatened to</a
      >, Netanyahu could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing
      elections to be held. After Trump signalled that he wanted to remove
      Palestinians from the Gaza Strip entirely, it was clear the ceasefire as
      originally negotiated was not long for this world.
    </p>

    <p>
      After meeting with Netanyahu and doubling down on the ethnic cleansing of
      Palestinians, Hamas suspended the release of the hostages on February
      10th. While reaffirming their commitment to the ceasefire,
      <a
        href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-48200/netanyahu-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-hostages-trump"
        >Hamas questioned Israel’s</a
      >, and accused the state of not upholding their end of the deal. Although
      Hamas would revoke that suspension on February 13th, with
      <a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-security-official-accuses-netanyahu-of-working-to-avoid-hostage-deal-2nd-phase/"
        >Netanyahu dodging the 2nd round of negotiations</a
      >, it appeared Hamas was correct in their assessment. Netanyahu would
      continue to skirt his promises, and tensions would continue to rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a couple of weeks of continued hostage/prisoner exchanges and
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trumps-remarks-plan-take-over-gaza-displace-palestinians-2025-02-20/"
        >escalatory statements from Donald Trump</a
      >, March 1st arrived and the ceasefire was scheduled to end. Following
      Hama’s rejection of a US led proposal to extend the ceasefire into Ramadan
      and Passover, Israel blocked humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The
      humanitarian aid blockade was condemned by mediators Egypt and Qatar, as
      well as the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>,
      as a violation of the ceasefire, which stipulated that phase one would
      automatically be extended as long as phase two negotiations were in
      progress.

      On March 9th, Israeli energy minister Eli Cohen ordered to halt supply of
      Israeli electricity to Gaza. Having lost a
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67103298"
        >significant chunk of their leadership</a
      >
      and a good portion of their
      <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/what-gazans-want"
        >goodwill with Palestinians</a
      >, Hamas said that it agreed to a proposal from mediators to release
      Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander and the bodies of four dual
      national hostages on March 14th. Israel and the US rejected the offer,
      Israel claiming that
      <a
        href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/14/hamas-edan-alexander-hosrtages-ceasefire"
        >Hamas was intending to sabotage</a
      >
      the negotiations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, on March 18th,
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-17-2025-b8753b9458a44f10ab08aa9b12582780"
        >Israel launched airstrikes</a
      >
      across the Gaza Strip. Israel claimed that they were striking dozens of
      Hamas targets, and Netanyahu stated a lack of progress in ceasefire talks
      was the reasoning behind the strikes. According to the Gaza Health
      Ministry, over 400 Palestinians were killed. Thought to be part of an
      expanding offensive,
      <a
        href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/19/israels-netanyahu-warns-deadly-gaza-onslaught-only-the-beginning"
        >Netanyahu confirmed Israel’s intent</a
      >
      in a televised address. Netanyahu stated “This was only the beginning” and
      that future ceasefire negotiations would “only take place under fire.”

      With the death toll officially exceeding 50,000 (according to Gaza Health
      Ministry officials), there seems to be no end in sight to this conflict.

      importantly, people are going to suffer as a result.
