      Over the last six weeks, Elon has seemed untouchable. With Trump’s
      blessings and a Republican Congress willing to provide cover, Elon has
      been slashing federal agencies to his heart’s content. However, this week,
      a momentum shift appears to have put Elon on the defensive.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be fair, the mistakes have been glaring. The five largest claimed
      savings on the “Wall of Receipts” were incorrect and subsequently removed.
      The
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/upshot/doge-spending-cuts-changed.html">mistakes</a>
      range from typos—such as mistakenly claiming billions in savings that were
      actually just millions—to more substantial miscalculations, like counting
      one contract multiple times, assuming the total possible allocation for a
      contract as the amount actually saved, and taking credit for canceling
      big-ticket items that were either completed and paid for years ago or
      scrapped during prior presidential terms.

    <p>
      Somehow, DOGE.gov has only increased its estimated savings, jumping from
      $65 billion last week to more than $100 billion this week. Those numbers
      are far beyond what the website actually shows. A closer look at the
      actual records reveals only about $30 billion in listed savings. However,
      the numbers are highly suspicious. The “Wall of Receipts” for real estate
      boasts nearly 500 million in savings, but the list of lease cancellations
      initially posted by the GSA was removed Wednesday with a promise to
      return. More than 1,000 of the contracts have either been modified or
      removed. Another 1,000 of the contracts listed show no savings at all.
      NPR’s Analysis confirms actual savings closure to 2.3 billion.

      This week though, it's starting to seem like Elon is feeling the heat.
      There have already been attempts to cover for Elon in court by claiming he
      <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/white-house-claims-elon-musk-doesnt-run-doge/story?id=118913206">isn’t actually running DOGE</a>.
      <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-elon-musk-government-workforce-cuts-opinion-poll-2025-03-02/">Polls on Elon</a>
      a majority of American disapprove of his access and influence. His
      companies are taking a hit too, particularly Tesla.
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/business/musk-trump-tesla-shares-slide/index.html">Sales are plummeting in Europe, and the stock is showing signs</a>
      of wear. Some estimates suggest that Elon has lost about $100 billion in
      net worth since January. Regardless of what he believes people voted for,
      the
      <a href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-chainsaw-trump-doge-6568e9e0cfc42ad6cdcfd58a409eb312">chainsaw antics</a>
      are turning off voters and costing him money.

      Republicans are scrambling to protect him. Recently, they claimed that he
      is not actually in charge of DOGE, but that Amy Gleason is—despite Trump
      explicitly crediting Elon with leading the department during his speech to
      Congress this week, much to the chagrin of lawyers currently suing over
      the fact that Elon has not been formally appointed by Congress. Meanwhile,
      Republicans argue that Musk isn’t responsible for firing government
      employees; rather, they claim that federal agencies are the ones
      terminating workers—and, in fact, they’re doing it incorrectly. Rep. Andy
      Barr speculated that agencies are either being
      <a href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-doge-trump-blame-federal-workers-republicans-2945026366f42b0879087f2e7d4b9d71">incompetent or attempting to sabotage Musk’s efforts by mass firing</a>.

      All roads lead to Rome as they say, and I guess in Rome, federal workers
      are always to blame.

      Elon’s ducking and dodging is no surprise, nor his tactics. Recall that
      his defense in a lawsuit over running an illegal lottery was actually that
      it wasn’t a lottery because the winners were selected and not random.
      While he has capital to burn, the pressure is starting to get to him. It
      will be interesting to see how well he holds up while taking the heat for
      Trump. The shifting narrative around his actual role suggests that reality
      may finally be catching up with him.
