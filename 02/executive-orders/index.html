    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited, or relevant to the application of law,
      only that they are almost never controlling in a court of law.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

      14220 – Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Copper
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-28/pdf/2025-03439.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 sets out that copper is both an essential material to the US and
      that our smelting and refining capacity lags behind global competitors. It
      states that the Administration wishes to ensure a reliable, secure, and
      resilient domestic copper supply chain. Further the EO purports to be an
      enforcement of 232 of the Trade Expansion Act with regards to imports of
      copper, scrap copper, and copper derivative products.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 orders the Secretary of Commerce to investigate under 232 of the
      TEA to determine the effects on national security of the various imports
      related to copper. Such determination is to be conducted with the factors
      set forth in 19 USC 1862(d) regarding national defense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Commerce to consult with the Secretary
      of Defense, Interior, and Energy as well as any other agency heads deemed
      necessary regarding the national security risks associated with imported
      copper.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO could have been an email to the Secretary of Commerce. There is no
      decision about investment, halting trade, or other policy action that
      would actually affect the copper market within the US. Essentially the
      Administration deemed it necessary to sign an EO asking the Secretary of
      Commerce to look into copper imports.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act is likely a favorite of the
      Administration as it bars congress from decreasing or eliminating tariffs
      implemented by the Administration under the
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title19/chapter4&amp;edition=prelim"
        >Tariff Act of 1930</a
      >. Additionally, it allows for the compiling of a report for imports
      affecting national security. It empowers the executive to take action to
      ensure the imported commodity is regulated sufficiently to not negatively
      affect national security. Ultimately, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
      Act only reinforces that this EO is redundant.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that in mind, this EO is a clear signal to the Administration’s base
      about their focus on manufacturing and isolationist policies.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This, like many EOs, will simply pad the register. I will not get into the
      intricacies of US copper imports, because I do not personally care or have
      the knowledge to do so. If you are interested for some reason in the
      minutia, I will direct you to
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/where-does-us-get-its-copper-2025-02-26/"
        >this article</a
      >. It’s not clear the fallout, or even motivation beyond virtue signaling
      about isolationism, of this EO.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have no support for this, but I’m going to go ahead and assume the
      Administration

      14221 – Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients With Clear,
      Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-28/pdf/2025-03440.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 calls back to Donald Trump’s prior administration’s goal to
      increase transparency in healthcare pricing and costs. It directly cites
      to EO 13877 that required disclosure of price information. It goes on to
      state, without clear support, that the first EO was a resounding success
      (a generous reading of history for EO 13877), yet also has left room for
      more executive action.
    </p>

    <p>Section 2 then says it is the policy of the Administration to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and
        take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency
        requirements;
      </li>
      <li>Increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and</li>
      <li>
        Identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price
        information. (including the expansion of price transparency
        requirements)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Section 3 requires the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS to take
      all appropriate actions to rapidly implement and enforce healthcare price
      transparency regulations issued pursuant to EO 13877 within 90 days of the
      signing of the EO.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This is essentially a rerelease of EO 13877, but with a broader scope and
      less specific goal. While EO 13877 was tied to a limited set of services
      that were to have defined prices for patients, this EO now just asks for
      “more transparency”. It’s not clear how, or to whom, this will be applied.
    </p>

    <p>
      While insurers are mentioned in both EOs, the hospitals and providers bear
      the brunt of the public ire as a result of how the two EOs have been
      reported on. That is not to say insurers were not affected by it. Insurers
      have, for the most part, complied, but are largely left out of the
      conversation when talking about healthcare pricing.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      While this EO appears to simply reiterate a previous EO, it is a good foil
      to compare Trump’s previous presidency to the current one. Where EO 13877
      was limited in scope, had defined goals, and placed actual plans of action
      to achieve said goals, this EO is so broad as to have no real purpose. It
      is a good example of the Administration’s MO to provide good sounding
      initiatives and goals with little to no substance.
    </p>

    <p>
      EO 13877 was impactful, though whether good or bad remains a debate, and
      led to some actual rule changes that
      <a
        href="https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2021/09/price-transparency-in-hospitals-is-hospital-pricing-data"
        >survived challenges in the courts. It’s not clear how this iteration
        will improve on its predecessor. It’s unsurprising that the
        Administration wanted to bring attention to the previous EO, as it was
        one of the few universal positives from Trump’s previous term, at least
        in the mind of the public</a
      >.

      14222 – Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency”
      Cost Effective Initiative
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-28/pdf/2025-03440.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 states that the EO is to commence a transformation regarding
      federal spending in order to make it transparent and to make government
      employees accountable to the American public.
    </p>

    <p>Section 2 is just a bunch of definitions.</p>

    <p>
      Section 3 requires agency heads to coordinate with agency DOGE teams to
      build a “centralized technological system” within the agency to record
      payments issued by the agency. It details a requirement for justifications
      to be written for such payments and the agency head’s ability to check
      such justifications. Further a comprehensive review of the agencies
      contracting policies are to be done within 30 days. The DOGE teams within
      the agencies are to take part in such oversight, and are included in
      almost every step of these processes. Finally the EO requires each agency
      head to provide a real property report of all real property subject to the
      agency’s administration.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is a further expansion of the Administration’s direct control of
      the various executive agencies. It also attempts to instill the DOGE
      entity as a kind of Administration oversight for spending within the
      executive branch. This new monitoring and justification of payments within
      agencies belies a clear misunderstanding of the internal functions of the
      government and the agencies of the executive branch.
    </p>

    <p>
      This EO, and the others that spread DOGE through our government, attempt
      to adopt the CCP’s method of blending party with state. DOGE is able to
      monitor every function within the government, and report back to the
      Administration. This may seem redundant, as the president is the head of
      the executive branch, and functionally already controls these
      organizations. Such a conclusion is misguided, as the “justification” and
      “approval” process is a way to monitor the employees in these agencies and
      ensure loyalty to Trump rather than the government.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      While the Administration claims to have the goal of reducing government
      expenses and bureaucracy, this EO does neither, and in fact increases
      both. Adding additional personnel to oversee agencies, and every
      expenditure of said agency, will inevitably increase the expense and
      bureaucratic bloat of the executive branch significantly. Beyond DOGE
      itself, requiring a justification for each expenditure, paired with the
      evaluation of said justification, will also significantly increase
      government bloat. The delay in spending, which is not to imply that
      government action was rapid prior to this EO, will cause delays in
      assistance to the vulnerable and further increase cost of individual
      projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond this hypocrisy regarding efficiency, we are approaching what feels
      like the beginning of a Ministry of Truth within the government. The
      “justifications” for spending will likely be used as purity tests, and one
      of many methods by which to control speech and thought of government
      workers. When viewed with the firings under Tulsi Gabbard of CIA personnel
      whose only crime was
      <a
        href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/gabbard-fires-100-intelligence-officers-messages-chat-tool-rcna193799"
        >discussing trans people</a
      >, it is clear that loyalty to the ideology of MAGA is the ultimate goal
      of this and similar EOs.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there is little to be done to fight such an EO, as it is simply
      establishing policy within the executive branch, it is unclear how
      impactful it will be. At best, it might simply mean there is a no-show job
      for some DOGE employee in each agency who simply rubber stamps the extra
      form each government employee will fill out for a request for payment. At
      worst, it could mean that DOGE will have access and records of government
      spending with little oversight as to how they will use or dispense with
      it. With any luck, the time and expense of actually implementing this EO
      will result in the Administration quietly ignoring it.
