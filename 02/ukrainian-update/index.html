    <p>
      It’s been a whirlwind of developments for anyone following the latest on
      the Russian war on Ukraine. On March 2, 2025, a brand-new “<a
        href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo"
        >Coalition of the Willing</a
      >” took shape in Europe—<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Russo-Ukrainian_War)"
        >18 World Leaders</a
      >
      set on reinforcing their commitment to Ukraine and outlining their own 4
      point plan. That collective effort might have been cause for optimism…
      until the very next day, when the
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/03/us/trump-news-congress"
        >Trump administration halted</a
      >
      aid that’s been crucial to Ukraine’s defense. According to officials, “The
      order affects more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition in the pipeline
      and on order,” including equipment and goods that had already reached as
      far as Poland in some cases.

    <p>
      By Tuesday, March 4, 2025, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had already made
      it clear that the United States accounted for roughly 30% of Ukraine’s
      defensive capabilities—a massive portion Kyiv simply couldn’t afford to
      lose. Faced with this new reality,
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/ukraine-us-trump-military-support.html"
        >Zelenskyy</a
      >
      took steps that many interpreted as attempts to appease the U.S.,
      including hints that his administration was ready to negotiate peace under
      terms more favorable to Washington’s position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without skipping a beat on Wednesday, March 5th, the United States either
      ignored Zelenskyy’s attempts at mending a bridge—or perhaps got too cozy
      with the idea of building one with Putin—and
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/us-ukraine-intelligence-sharing-00213100"
        >announced</a
      >
      it would be pausing all intelligence sharing. Which is honestly
      mind-blowing for a bunch of reasons. For one, Ukraine helped stand up the
      <a href="https://www.act.nato.int/article/nato-ukraine-open-jatec/"
        >Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC) in Poland</a
      >—a hub that takes real-time lessons from the conflict and feeds them back
      into NATO’s playbook. And let’s not forget that the U.S. was providing the
      majority of Ukraine’s intel to begin with—from satellite imagery to
      signals intelligence. Cut that off, and we’re leaving Ukraine in the dark
      at a critical moment in the war.
    </p>

    <p>
      On March 6, 2025, President Zelenskyy announced an upcoming meeting
      between Ukraine and the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. While he is set to meet with
      Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his team will remain to “work with our
      American partners. Ukraine is most interested in peace.” That same day,
      France reaffirmed its commitment to providing intelligence to Ukraine,
      signaling Europe’s growing role as the U.S. pulls back.
    </p>

    <p>
      By March 7, the situation deteriorated further when U.S. aerospace firm
      Maxar Technologies abruptly suspended Ukraine’s access to high-resolution
      satellite imagery. This critical tool for tracking Russian troop movements
      was lost just two days after the intelligence-sharing pause, reinforcing
      doubts about Washington’s commitment. The lack of an official explanation
      only heightened concerns that the U.S. was deliberately scaling back its
      involvement.

    <p>
      On March 8, Russia seized the opportunity, launching a fresh wave of
      missile and drone strikes across Ukraine. Key energy infrastructure was
      hit, deepening fears that Ukraine’s already stretched air defenses will
      struggle without a steady flow of U.S. military aid. Meanwhile, France,
      Germany, and the U.K. discussed expanding intelligence-sharing efforts to
      offset the U.S. withdrawal.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is increasingly clear that while Washington steps back, Europe is
      stepping in, whether the U.S. approves or not. Meanwhile, Russia remains
      uninterested in negotiations, escalating attacks as Ukraine scrambles to
      adapt. With civilian infrastructure, energy grids, and military targets in
      Moscow’s crosshairs, the Kremlin’s strategy of attrition is in full force.
