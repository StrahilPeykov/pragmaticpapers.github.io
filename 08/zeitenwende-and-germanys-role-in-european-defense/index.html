      On February 27, 2022, Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz addressed the
      Bundestag and fundamentally altered Germany’s role in Europe. Russia’s
      reinvasion of Ukraine three days prior had sparked shock and outrage in
      Berlin, who’s previous
      <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364173085_Germany_and_Russia_Farewell_to_Ostpolitik"
        ><em>Ostpolitik </em>approach to Russia was suddenly proven
        ineffective.</a
      >
      <em>Ostpolitik </em>dates back to West German efforts to normalize
      relations with East Germany, with the end goal of incentivizing Soviet
      bloc countries to accept their trade, and through trade, change. This
      change did not occur, and Russia proved it was not interested in an
      international rules-based order, or in staying in the good graces of the
      West. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the response was muted. Angela
      Merkel, the Chancellor at the time, insisted that there was “no military
      solution” to the crisis. She was determined to hold on to the post 1991
      world order, in which <em>Ostpolitik</em> was the prevailing policy, with
      warm ties to the US, and non-aggressive ones for Russia. Wandel durch
      Handel, Change through Trade, was thought to be the most effective way of
      calming a seemingly imperialism-inclined Russia. The invasion shattered
      this idea. The result was the Zeitenwende, the turning point of Germany’s
      role in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his iconic speech, the Chancellor proclaimed “<a
        href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/search/policy-statement-by-olaf-scholz-chancellor-of-the-federal-republic-of-germany-and-member-of-the-german-bundestag-27-february-2022-in-berlin-2008378"
        >The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a watershed in the history of
        our continent.”</a
      >
      Now, Scholz claimed, it was Germany’s time to “...accept the challenge
      that now faces us – with clear-headed resolve.” To do this, Scholz
      outlined key courses of actions Germany must take:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supporting Ukraine in their desperate situation.</li>
      <li>
        Standing unconditionally by their collective defense obligations to Nato
        and rearming the Bundeswehr.
      </li>
      <li>Phasing out German reliance on Russian energy.</li>
      <li>
        Using sanctions and Germany’s heavy economic weight to increase the cost
        of Russia’s invasion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With this, Berlin planned to take a more active role in European defense,
      a complete departure from previous policy. Two weeks prior, the German
      foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had appeared at the<a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukrainian-president-munich-conference-russia-volodymyr-zelenskiy"
      >
        Munich security conference</a
      >
      to warn that the crisis should not lead to an 180-degree turn on the
      decades-old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. On
      the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying Germany could
      not impose the strongest sanctions possible because of “the massive
      collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing
      at us, she warned. So great was the umbrella of <em>Ostpolitik, </em
      ><a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2022/ukraine-road-to-war/"
        >Germany refused to believe the American and UK intelligence reports
        indicating an invasion was imminent</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the death of Ostpolitik and introduction of
      <a
        href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/ia/INTA92_1_02_Forsberg.pdf"
        >“Frostpolitik”</a
      >, and in the wake of a bipolar POTUS, Germany has shifted its views on
      defense, and its own role in the Franco-German engine which powers Europe.
      Now, three years since the declaration, has the Zeitenwende been
      fulfilled? With Friedrich Merz replacing Scholz, what will that mean for
      the new defense goals? And what does the future of Europe look like with a
      rearmed Germany taking center stage?
    </p>
    <h4>
      <a id="_bcxvlz76qu4g"></a>Assessing the Implementation of Zeitenwende
    </h4>
    <p>
      The first question to be asked should be: “How well was Zeitenwende
      implemented?”.
      <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin"
        >Support amongst Germans reached 78%</a
      >
      for the new policies, but some critics such as Benjamin Tallis of
      International Politik Quarterly said "Zeitenwende is here, it's just
      unevenly distributed”, a reference to William Gibson’s famous quote.
      Later, though, he grew more fierce, saying
      <a href="https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/end-zeitenwende"
        >“Germany’s Zeitenwende has failed.”</a
      >
      Zeitenwende support has certainly waned, and the popularity of parties
      like Alternative for Germany and The Left show an increasing shift in
      German perception of the war. However, the incoming chancellor
      <a

        >Friedrich Merz has been clear and vocal in his support for Ukraine, and

      >, it is clear Germany is looking to establish a long term safety net
      within Europe, and set the example for other EU countries to follow.

    <p>
      If we compare the infamous

      to today, it is clear Berlin has made great strides in its stated goal.

        >Germany is now the largest European supporter of Ukraine, and third in

      >
        bilateral security cooperation agreement</a
      >
      with Ukraine was signed, with Germany pledging to support long-term
      development of Ukraine’s security sector, as well as providing
      cybersecurity and intelligence support. Germany has accepted more
      Ukrainian refugees than any other country in the EU, 1.14 million. It has
      become a major supplier of weapons, including but not limited to: 619
      reconnaissance VECTOR drones, 9 Zuzana 2 wheeled self-propelled howitzer,
      269 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, 16,917 RGW 90 man-portable
      anti-tank weapons, and of course,

        >58,000 combat helmets</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, lingering concerns over Germany’s past has still prevented it
      from being too forward leaning in supplies. It has not sent any Taurus
      long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv (though equivalents like the UK’s Storm
      Shadow and France’s SCALP have been), and has
      <a

        >refused to allow German weapons to be used to strike inside Russian
        territory</a
      >. Some critics argue the German government still fears escalation with
      Russia, and that<a

      >
        Berlin has allowed the Kremlin to bully them</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Trump
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x5xn1g92o"
        >threatening to pull out of Ukraine completely</a
      >
      if no progress is soon made, Germany now has a burden of responsibility to
      lead the effort to defend Ukraine. It can no longer completely rely on
      America to assist, and it seems increasingly likely that the Franco-German
      engine will be powering Ukraine’s security without transatlantic help.
      Merz has said he would do "whatever it takes" to protect peace and freedom
      - referencing Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012. In a debate
      during his campaign, he said "I have absolutely no illusions about what is
      happening from America. Just look at the recent interventions in the
      German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk — that is a unique event. The
      interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and
      ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. We
      are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority
      now really is to create unity in Europe."
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-germany-election-united-states-donald-trump-nato/"
        >Merz is aware of the potential death of NATO</a
      >, and what that could entail as a leader of Europe’s largest economy. The
      current cooperation only worked as it did because Washington and Berlin
      agreed on the overall outline of their role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeitenwende has killed <em>Ostpolitik</em>, but like a cheesy horror movie
      villain, it could always rise again. Rising isolationist tendencies in
      both countries are on the rise, and as the war drags on, more and more
      voices will begin to lose sight of the benefits of assisting Ukraine. They
      will call for a resumption of <em>Ostpolitik</em>, as decades of
      Russo-German relationships have not simply disappeared. Rising concerns
      over the reliability of the US may lead Germany more into the arms of its
      once alternative partner. With Merz taking a strong stance on Ukraine, and
      an even stronger one against Trump, it is clear that, at least for now,
      Germany will continue to be a world leader in Ukrainian assistance.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_q5rt02cg1pyz"></a>NATO and the Bundeswehr’s role</h4>
    <p>
      The Zeitenwende speech brought back two key terms in the German
      consciousness, <em>landesverteidigung</em> and
      <em>bündnisverteidigung</em>, national and collective defense.
      <a
        href="https://www.bmvg.de/resource/blob/5702190/edabed114d7856c8aa71ad666cbce8b3/download-defence-policy-guidelines-2023-data.pdf"
        >In the first defense guidelines</a
      >, Scholz and his traffic light coalition stressed that these must once
      again be the core task of the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr suffered from
      chronic underfunding and taboo since the end of the Cold War. Indeed,
      German President Horst Köhler
      <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10198036.stm"
        >resigned</a
      >
      in 2010, after receiving heavy backlash for saying:<em>
        “...a country of our size needs to be aware that where called for or in
        an emergency, military deployment, too, is necessary if we are to
        protect our interests such as ensuring free trade routes or preventing
        regional instabilities which are also certain to negatively impact our
        ability to safeguard trade, jobs and income.” </em
      >Since then, Germany has hit the<a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-met-nato-2-defence-spending-target-2024-sources-say-2025-01-20/"
      >
        required 2% mark of NATO</a
      >, and with the removal of the debt break, will be able to have the funds
      necessary to hit its own goal of 203,000 personnel and full combat
      readiness by 2027.
      <a
        href="https://ip-quarterly.com/en/zeitenwende-here-its-just-unevenly-distributed"
        >Those who raised concerns about long term funding sustainability</a
      >
      will have those concerns eased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor to consider is forces and troop readiness. At the 2022
      Madrid summit<a
        href="https://www.bmvg.de/de/aktuelles/nato-force-model-wie-deutschland-sich-ab-2025-engagiert-5465714"
        >, NATO members agreed an updated NATO Force Model to be implemented by
        2025</a
      >. The Model organizes troops into three tiers of readiness and the new
      <a
        href="https://www.bmvg.de/de/aktuelles/drehscheibe-deutschland-transport-und-logistik-nato-und-eu-5505038"
        >Allied Reaction Force</a
      >
      for support. This new reform places heavy demands on NATO allies, and
      would likely require the growth of the Budeswehr’s current strength of
      180,000 to beyond its own goal of 203,000.
      <a
        href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/verteidigung-welche-rolle-deutschland-kuenftig-in-der-nato-spielen-kann/100050300.html"
        >Germany has acknowledged the personnel issue, and the challenges it
        brings</a
      >. According to the reports on internal Ministry of Defense deliberations,
      the requirement for NATO land forces will rise from 82 combat brigades to
      131. Germany will likely need to assign 5 or 6 more brigades to NATO. Five
      brigades means an extra 25,000 personnel,
      <a
        href="https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/ueber-die-bundeswehr/zahlen-daten-fakten/personalzahlen-bundeswehr"
        >above the current 61,000 strength of the military</a
      >. At the current pace, it seems Germany will likely fail to meet this
      threshold.

      >
    </div>
    <p>
      Germany also plans to station a combat brigade permanently in Lithuania,
      setting it apart from other NATO members. In 2023, Berlin declared it
      would permanently station 4,800 troops and 200 civilian employees in
      Lithuania. This would be the first time in German history that the armed
      forces would be stationed abroad without an end date. The brigade will
      consist of three major combat units: the 122 Mechanised Infantry Battalion
      from Oberviechtach, Bavaria; the 203 Tank Battalion from Augustdorf, North
      Rhine-Westphalia; and the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group
      Lithuania. The brigade is currently operational, with full capability
      expected by 2027. This is the surest commitment to the Zeitenwende’s
      goals, and shows Germany as a forward-thinking, example-setting nation for
      others to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, overreliance on NATO could be a double-edged sword. The American
      security umbrella provides safety, but an increasingly hesitant Washington
      has signaled that Europe must take a more active role in its own security.
      Chancellor Scholz has clearly shown he wants to focus more on cooperation
      with NATO for security, over cooperation with the EU. Germany has entered
      voluntary initiatives such as Permanent Structured Cooperation, and has
      attempted to wield financial leverage through multinational projects such
      as the European Defense Fund. Besides this, Scholz called for improved
      compatibility through an EU structure to better strengthen NATO. In the
      end, the Zeitenwende has not led to any systematic changes to reverse
      negative European defense trends. Former Italian Prime Minister Mario
      Draghi highlighted the fragmentation of the defense industry and the lack
      of collaborative industrial projects on major arms systems as major issues
      for the future of the EU. If the incoming Merz government wants to assert
      Germany as a leader of Europe, and set the example for European security
      independence, it will need to reevaluate its positions on NATO, and focus
      more on a collective European defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federal Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, has<a
        href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/boris-pistorius-mahnt-kriegstuechtigkeit-bis-2029-an-a-063d1ce1-6dda-453e-bd33-1acf9be2558a"
      >
        set the goal</a
      >
      for making the Bundeswehr fully combat capable by 2029. With the debt
      brake removal, this goal seems increasingly possible, but will require a
      long-term, fundamental cultural shift around defense. It will need to be
      insulated from changing political whims, a guideline for all parties to
      follow. Increasing popularity for nationalist parties like AfD only
      further highlights the dangers. A rearmed Germany could protect Europe,
      and the world, but a fully revamped Bundeswehr in the hands of AfD leaders
      could potentially lead to leveraging military might for bullying purposes
      and increase the risk of war in Europe.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_na9llsj7dro4"></a>Weaning off Russian energy</h4>
    <p>
      For decades, Russian fossil fuels have powered Germany’s industrial and
      economic might. Energy relations underpinned German defense strategy with
      Russia, not changing even after the 2014 invasion. It fueled
      <em>Ostpolitik</em>, the financial benefits incentivizing overlooking
      Russian crimes in favor of economic gain. This changed in 2022, when
      Zeitenwende forced Germany to reevaluate its reliance on Russian power.
      Energy constitutes a huge part of Russia’s income, and not addressing it
      risked undermining the objective of confronting Russian imperialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Russia was Germany’s primary natural gas supplier, amounting to<a
        href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/20230105_RueckblickGas2022.html"
      >
        52% of total imports in 2021</a
      >. Now, the number has dropped to 22%, with other countries such as Norway
      helping pick up the slack. Berlin closed a deal with Qatar for the
      delivery of new
      <a
        href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-second-lng-terminal-open-for-business/"
        >LNG terminals</a
      >
      in 2026, explored opportunities with Iraq for the delivery of oil and gas.
      Germany is creating a new energy infrastructure, and is building a supply
      line to significantly reduce its reliance on Russian gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, weaning lead to new issues. Volatile energy prices hit Germany
      hard, but it was able to shoulder the burden through energy-saving
      efforts, a temporary increase in coal usage and tax breaks. The cost to
      counter prices and curb inflation
      <a
        href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Artikel/Energie/strom-gaspreis-bremse.html"
        >rose to around 300 billion dollars</a
      >. Price increases were mitigated, but not completely prevented.

        >Some energy-intensive companies have already left Germany</a
      >, and seem unlikely to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenges still face Germany on energy security, despite it being
      arguably the most successful part of the Zeitenwende. Renewables are
      nondispatchable, and can be a problem particularly when peak demand meets
      weak generation (For example, a cloudy day with no wind). Renewable energy
      technology also creates a reliance on dominant producers, such as China,
      which comes with its own set of issues. Cost can also be a factor, with
      <a

      300 billion in investments will be needed solely for the German power grid
      by 2025. Whether the incoming government will allocate for these
      investments remains to be seen, but is likely.

      energy will have to be the way moving forward for Germany. Indeed,

        >German politicians have even begun calling renewables “freedom
        energies</a
      >”. This reflects Berlin’s commitment to sustainable, green energy, as
      well as its view that it will be the vehicle for German energy security
      and independence. The Easter legislative package outlined<a

      >
        renewable energy in particular</a
      >, focusing on bottlenecks that prevented expansion and integration of
      renewables. This includes a law obliging states to ensure at least 2
      percent of Germany’s surface area is available for onshore wind by 2032.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2023 alone,
      <a
        href="https://www.energy-charts.info/charts/installed_power/chart.htm?l=en&amp;c=DE&amp;year=2023&amp;legendItems=3x27v"
        >solar capacity deployment rate more than doubled, and wind generated
        more electricity than coal for the first time</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Loyle Campbell and Tim Bosch’s essay “Zeitenwende Energy Policy”, they
      provide a clear list of recommendations for German energy security moving
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Commit to an irreversible transition where Germany is independent from
      Russian fossil fuels.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Replicate the decisive strategy to diversify natural gas into green
      supply chains to reduce reliance on China.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Continue realizing the strategic evolution of energy security by taking
      steps to Europeanize energy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Establish EU-US dialogue to align LNG imports with sustainability
      criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Refocus efforts to use the EU-US Trade and Technology Council to
      resolve emerging divergences on green industrial policy and efforts to
      derisk from China.
    </p>
    <p>
      By implementing these recommendations, Berlin can wean itself off the
      Russian energy teat, and instead use reliable, sustainable trading
      partners and practices to its advantage, leading to a more independent and
      insulated German energy sector. While completely decoupling from China is
      not feasible, Germany can reduce its reliance on relationships with
      authoritarian states, and pave the way forward for European energy.

      When Olaf Scholz declared the Zeitenwende, it upended a quarter of a
      century’s worth of <em>Ostpolitik, </em>forever changing Germany’s
      non-adversarial relationship with Russia. Since the 2022 reinvasion,
      Russian and German relations have greatly deteriorated.
      <em>Ostpolitik</em> had two key pillars,
      <em>Wandel durch Annäherung</em> (change through rapprochement) and
      <em>Wandel durch Handel </em>(change through trade). The idea was to
      productively engage with Moscow, leading to positive changes in the
      Soviet’s view on Germany, and
      <a
        href="https://assets.cambridge.org/97805212/36676/sample/9780521236676ws.pdf"
        ><em>moderate Soviet behavior</em></a
      >. For thirty years <em>Ostpolitik </em>persisted, and Berlin was
      determined to engage with a new Russia and help enable the transition into
      a democratic market society. Germany was grateful that the Soviets had
      allowed Germany to peacefully reunite, and became Russia’s most important
      partner in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Germany was more willing than others to take seriously Russia’s insistence
      on being treated like a world power as a result. It ignored and downplayed
      Central and Eastern European concerns about a potential Russian return to
      its imperial ambitions. Germany viewed Europe, it seemed, through a
      <a

        >Russian lens</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Putin,

        >the German in the Kremlin</a

      <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21340"

      >
      with <em>Annäherung durch Verflechtung </em>(rapprochement through
      interdependence). 2014 was not enough to change this, with then Chancellor
      Merkel seeking a peaceful resolution, still stubbornly adhering to
      <em>Ostpolitik </em>policies which had been proven failures,

      After 2022, Germany froze Russian assets, weaned itself off Russian
      energy, and became the second largest supplier to Ukraine. Russia
      miscalculated, believing Germany would never impose sanctions, as the cost
      to its own business relationships would be too great. Putin likely though
      Scholz would stick to the long precedent of <em>Ostpolitik, </em>as his
      predecessor Merkel had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zeitenwende took Russia by surprise. The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline was
      destroyed, costing Russia 11 billion dollars from the construction, and
      countless billions from lost revenue. Germany led the charge with removing
      Russian banks from SWIFT, and currently is the leader in helping corral
      its EU partners into maintaining the sanctions. Thanks to Germany’s
      efforts, the ruble collapsed, Russia was forced to grapple with the
      consequences of its war.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the cost of war was not too great for Russia. Despite initial
      predictions of an economic collapse, Russia’s economy actually grew in
      2023 by 3.6% and another 4% in 2024. Indicators such as GDP growth and low
      unemployment became Putin’s trump cards, using them as proof that
      sanctions are ineffective. The Chinese lifeline Russia desperately clings
      to seems to be pulling them up, and out, something Germany has been
      hesitant to respond to, given its own reliance on Chinese goods. China is
      weaponizing it’s trade leverage in a
      <a
        href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/48/1/91/117127/Collective-Resilience-Deterring-China-s"
        >“predatory liberalism”</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Germany does acknowledge its vulnerability of supply chains and
      exports from China, it does little to actively mitigate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2024 Munich Security Report does highlight China and Russia as the
      primary security challenges to Europe, and has a<a
        href="https://securityconference.org/assets/user_upload/MunichSecurityReport2024_Lose-lose.pdf"
      >
        significant focus on China’s impact</a
      >
      and lifeline to Russia. Germany’s first ever <em>NSS </em>(National
      Security Strategy) says “China is a partner, competitor, and systemic
      rival” and “China is trying in various ways to remould the existing
      rules-based international order”. Despite the strong words, Germany’s
      current strategy does not aim to decouple from China completely, as
      Chinese exports remain a crucial part of the German economy. Instead, it
      mirrors the EU’s “de-risking” approach, focusing on the need to fix
      economic vulnerabilities in critical sectors like raw materials and
      energy. Germany’s focus on China is to reduce economic dependencies while
      maintaining relations for common issues like fighting climate change. But
      no serious sanctions or consequences will currently be imposed for China’s
      enabling of a war in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      China has successfully cushioned the cost of war of Russia, leveraging its
      massive economy and few allies to create an alternate financial network
      for the country, allowing it to continue its prolonged occupation. Though
      Germany made a strong stance on sanctions, it is clear that it will not be
      able to fully increase economic strain on Russia. Germany played all its
      cards, but the Chinese ace up Russia’s sleeve proved too powerful for the
      massive European economy to fully combat. If Germany truly wishes for
      energy independence and to lead European security, it must devise a more
      decisive approach to China, and reduce it’s desperate dependency on
      authoritarian regimes to survive.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_v0t00mptv6pl"></a>Conclusion: The Zeitenwende is real</h4>
    <p>
      The removal of the debt brake and Merz’s continuance of Zeitenwende
      policies prove one thing: Germany is serious about its role in Europe.
      Since Donald Trump’s inauguration, Germany’s realization of the waning
      American umbrella has lit a fire underneath it to quickly modernize and
      expand its military capabilities. The wide support leads to an almost
      inevitable aura for the country, it will change. Merz has the political
      backing to assume more debt and increase defense spending, something
      terribly taboo only 4 years ago. Old formulas no longer apply, and the
      <a
        href="https://ip-quarterly.com/en/zeitenwende-here-its-just-unevenly-distributed"
        >Zeitenwende cannot be distributed unevenly</a
      >. Germany must step into its role in the Franco-German engine, and power
      the defense of Europe for generations to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other countries will applaud Germany’s efforts, for a time. Europe
      generally shares Germany’s sentiment towards Russia, and will be happy to
      accommodate more defense for Europe. Merz can build coalitions and
      interoperational coordination, something Scholz was hesitant to do in
      favor of building relations with NATO. This may potentially show
      Washington that Europe is serious about shouldering its share of the
      burden, and could lead to less fickleness in the White House regarding
      European security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Kissinger once said “Germany is too big for Europe, and too small
      for the world”. Germany cannot avoid being a dominant power in Europe, his
      thinking went, and it must rise to that responsibility. Germany has
      Europe’s largest economy and population. A powerful military would make it
      a natural leader, but may increase tensions in other countries, who also
      have memories of a powerful Germany.

    <p>
      Germany will only remain a force for good in the proper hands. The rise of
      isolationist, nationalist ideologies around the world poses a potential
      risk factor for the country. Though Germany of all countries has no desire
      to return to its former ways, populism is infectious. Its simplicity
      resonates with people, whose attention spans have shortened, and critical
      thinking skills declined. Charismatic strongman leaders can suddenly
      overtake a country, as we’ve seen in America, China, India, and Italy. A
      powerful Germany can be unsettling, and the idea of it falling into the
      hands of an AfD style party could prove catastrophic, and could provoke
      the rise of more nationalist leaders in neighboring countries, such as
      France’s National Rally party. A future German leader could forgo the
      European style of conflict resolution, in favor of military blackmail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of a waning United States, Germany must take its role in the
      center stage of Europe. The risks of a rearmed Germany are real, but a
      strong European defense will be needed, and German industry and economy
      can help facilitate a powerful, united Europe. With Germany as one of the
      leaders, Europe could put itself in a position where other superpowers
      must adhere to it, and not the other way around.
