      DOGE is spreading. Its chainsaw went to work this week to stop agencies
      that helped the homeless, recall volunteers to aid after disasters,
      prepare its plans to whittle the Energy Department, and intimidate a
      non-profit. But don’t worry, they are also making a fast track for rich
      people to get legal status in the US so they don’t have to be bothered by
      all that paperwork. Hopefully, this will cover the bill we now owe El
      Salvador for housing the “illegal immigrants” we disappeared. Or not.
      Apparently, even with all this “cost cutting” the government is running up

      health benefits covered while earning some money for educational expenses.

      Oh, and DOGE is also working to assign staff to non-profit agencies that
      get money from the federal government. Not government agencies, mind you.

      report this far and wide to warn other non-profits about what was

      Why is DOGE trying to claw their way into every agency that gets federal

      Data, among other things. A whistle blower came forward this week to
      report some odd findings at the NLRB. When DOGE accessed their data, they
      made sure to do it in a way that would not allow their actions to be
      tracked directly. However, a

      a large amount of data being sent out after DOGE got access and then
      observed Russian accounts trying to access the database shortly after.
      Whoever was trying to access the database had correct usernames and
      logins. The only reason those accounts were denied access was because of
      location-related blocks.

      What would drive a person’s mindset to go after the neediest among us? If
      you take a closer look at Musk, a disturbing picture emerges. First, Musk
      is hyper-concerned about the world population collapsing and has started a
      very weird effort to have as many babies as he possibly can. He is
      apparently up to 14 kids, that are known, and
      <a
        href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-offered-woman-15m-171241061.html#:~:text=Elsewhere%2C%20the%20outlet%20reported%20that%20Mr%20Musk%20asked%20a%20woman%20he%20knew%20through%20X%20if%20she%20wanted%20to%20have%20a%20baby%20with%20him%2C"
        >actively propositioning women to make more</a
      >. But it's strange to cry about population collapse while actively
      gutting the programs that help people survive long enough or reproduce or
      help them with the kids they have.. Unless your goal was never to save
      everyone– just a select few.

      My initial thought when Elon threw that “sieg heil” was he was trolling
      like a true internet fanboy, but what if there is something more to that
      gesture? What if, instead of a troll, it was more of a Freudian slip? The
      man has it in his genes. While his dad has gotten a lot of attention from
      various media, this is about his mom’s side. His grandfather, Joshua
      Haldeman, was deeply involved in the

        >Technocracy movement</a
      >
      that ran through the 1930’s, which much like today’s movement, thinks the
      government should be run by technical experts. Oh, and he may have thought

        >He definitely thought the apartheid movement</a
      >
      in South Africa was great. And let’s not forget – this region of South
      Africa was a haven for Nazi sympathizers after WWII.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m sorry, but Nazi gestures, apartheid past, an advocacy for the
      Technocracy movement trying to take over today mixed with fervent baby
      making while pulling the rug from programs that help the “lesser”
      people–there might be some causation in this correlation. Why work to
      build up a workforce of people when we have AI and automation on the
      horizon? It seems like the intent is to cull the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it feels like DOGE is targeting everything that keeps society humane,
      that’s because it is. This isn’t budget cutting– it’s ideological
      cleansing. The programs being gutted weren’t broken. They were lifelines–
      for disaster survivors, the unhoused, the young, the sick, the poor. They
      dared to serve the people who couldn’t pay for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the scariest part isn’t that they’re tearing it all down– it’s that
      so many believe they’ll never need what’s being destroyed. But luck is not
      permanence. No one is immune to a diagnosis, a layoff, a wildfire, a bad
      break. The line between “fit” and “forgotten” is thinner than you think.
      And disaster doesn’t give a damn about your tax bracket or your political
      alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      What kind of future are we building if we only make room for the people
      who already have everything? When we treat struggle like a character flaw
      and survival like a privilege?
    </p>
    <p>
      Start watching closely. Start calling it what it is. Because when the fall
      comes– and it will– there may not be a safety net to catch you.
