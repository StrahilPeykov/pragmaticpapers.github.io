      On Sunday, April 13th,
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/mayor-ukraines-sumy-says-over-20-dead-russian-missile-strike-2025-04-13/"
        >Russia</a
      >
      opened with its deadliest attack of the year, firing two ballistic
      missiles into the center of Sumy, killing 35 and injuring 129 more. The
      strike, which used cluster munitions according to Ukrainian officials, was
      targeted entirely at civilians, both on the street and in public
      transportation. President Zelenskyy was quick to condemn the strike as a
      “deliberate massacre,” made all the more horrific by its timing on Palm
      Sunday—a holy day for Christians around the world. As expected, Moscow
      quickly countered with its usual excuse—claiming it had targeted a
      “meeting of Ukrainian and Western officers.” Naturally, no evidence was
      provided, and Ukrainian officials found nothing of the sort at the site of
      the massacre. The news of the strike also reached President Trump, who,
      when asked about it, responded that he was told “they made a mistake”—once
      again downplaying the clear intentionality behind Russia’s actions. Moscow
      hasn’t denied the strike or where it hit—only who they meant to kill—so
      maybe Trump didn’t get the full story from his handlers in Moscow.

      In response to the escalating attacks across Ukraine, particularly those
      targeting civilians,
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-look-boost-ukraine-sanction-russia-sources-say-2025-04-14/"
        >U.S. lawmakers</a
      >
      introduced the Ukraine Support Act, aiming to provide security and
      reconstruction funding for Ukraine while ramping up sanctions on Russia.
      This move by Congress ran counter to Trump’s current “negotiating”
      strategy, which has largely involved opening doors for Moscow to reenter
      the global stage, often by shifting blame onto Zelenskyy and Biden.
      <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1911810667281023133">Trump</a>, when
      interviewed about Ukraine’s request to purchase $50 billion worth of
      Patriot missiles, responded: “He’s always looking to purchase missiles.
      Listen, when you start a war, you gotta know you can win a war. You don’t
      start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that
      people give you some missiles.”In Trump’s defense for saying something so
      egregiously horrid, Moscow’s collar might just be on a little too tight
      these days, because it’s becoming increasingly difficult for him to even
      pretend his allegiance to Putin is deniable.

      On Tuesday, April 15th, the

      administration quietly blocked a planned G7 statement that would have
      formally condemned Russia’s Palm Sunday strike on Sumy. The reason?
      According to diplomatic sources, the White House didn’t want to jeopardize
      “ongoing negotiations” with Moscow. Without U.S. backing, Canada was
      forced to scrap the statement entirely, leaving nearly 50 countries’ words
      of support for Ukraine to stand in contrast to America’s silence. Trump

        >again called the strike “terrible"</a
      >, but stuck to his earlier claim that Russia had simply made a mistake.
      At this point, it’s less about defending Putin and more about keeping the
      talking points clean for the next round of backchannel business pitches.

      Wednesday, April 16th,
      <a
        href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/16/ukraine-renews-martial-law"
        >Ukraine’s parliament</a
      >
      voted overwhelmingly to extend martial law and troop mobilization for
      another 90 days, pushing both measures through to August 6. While the move
      maintains critical wartime powers, it also delays elections—a reality that
      both Russia and the U.S. have started to publicly pressure Kyiv about.
      Putin, predictably, questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy and floated the idea
      of a UN-backed transitional government, while Trump already dubbed him a
      “dictator without elections” back in February. Despite that framing,
      support for martial law remains strong in Ukraine—even among opposition
      leaders—though former President Poroshenko accused Zelenskyy of using the
      measure to centralize power. Meanwhile, on the ground, Russia ramped up
      air attacks across the south,
      <a

        >injuring three in Odesa</a
      >
      and killing at least one person in Kherson, while also claiming minor
      gains in Donetsk. With the energy strike moratorium set to expire, both
      sides now seem to be holding their breath before the next escalation.

      On Thursday, we would see the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/memorandum-ukraine-us-minerals-deal-could-be-signed-thursday-zelenskiy-says-2025-04-17/"
        >Mineral Deal</a
      >—something covered multiple times since starting the Pragmatic
      Papers—come back to the forefront of discussions on U.S.-Ukraine
      relations. A memorandum of intent was officially signed, laying the
      groundwork for an economic partnership and a potential 80-page agreement
      that would grant the U.S. privileged access to Ukraine’s natural
      resources. Again, this isn’t the deal itself—just the first step,
      signaling that both parties are willing to keep negotiating. Treasury
      Secretary Scott Bessent noted,
      <a
        href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/ukraine-signs-outline-of-minerals-deal-with-the-us.html"
        >“We’re still working on the details,”</a
      >
      but said a finalized deal could be signed as early as next Friday. One
      important detail: there’s still zero mention of any kind of security
      guarantees. But hey, maybe—just maybe the Trump administration will
      surprise us next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday, April 18th, the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-ready-abandon-efforts-broker-russia-ukraine-peace-deal-rubio-says-2025-04-18/"
        >Trump administration’s</a
      >
      commitment to peace talks took another turn—this time by threatening to
      walk away from the negotiations entirely if “real progress” isn’t made
      within a matter of days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S.
      wouldn’t stick around “for weeks and months on end,” while Trump added
      that if either side drags things out, “you’re foolish, you’re fools,
      you’re horrible people, and we’re going to just take a pass.” This came
      just days after the administration blocked a G7 condemnation of Russia’s
      missile strike on civilians in Sumy, claiming it didn’t want to jeopardize
      talks, and after repeatedly stating it wouldn’t sell Ukraine additional
      missiles to “keep the peace window open.” Now, three days later, that
      window apparently isn’t even worth keeping open. All of this, of course,
      came from the president, who promised to end the war on day one. It's
      looking like Trump’s method of using “Concepts of a plan” instead of an
      actual plan is not a great move for a world leader, who knew?

      Saturday, April 19th,
      <a

        >Putin</a
      >
      announced a temporary Easter ceasefire and oversaw the largest prisoner
      swap since the war began—moves that, on the surface, looked like progress,
      but felt more like theater. The truce, which supposedly ran through Easter
      Sunday, didn’t stop Russian drones from flying over Ukrainian cities or
      prevent strikes in Odesa and Sumy. Zelenskyy dismissed the gesture as
      “Putin playing with human lives,” as air raid sirens still echoed across
      the country. Meanwhile, far more quietly, reports confirmed that the
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/europe/trump-administration-crimea-peace-talks-intl/index.html"
        >Trump</a
      >
      administration is prepared to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part
      of its proposed peace framework. That alone crosses one of Kyiv’s clearest
      red lines—but now that the United States has said it’s ready to walk away
      from the conflict entirely, this isn’t surprising. The Trump
      administration will begin pushing very uncomfortable concessions onto
      Ukraine, which, if they refuse, Trump can claim he tried and it’s
      pointless now, again shifting the blame onto Zelenskyy.
