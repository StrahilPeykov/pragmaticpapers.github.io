      501(c)4. SuperPac. Dark Money. If you have been in the space for a minute,
      you have probably heard these terms thrown around. You may have even
      googled around the web of terms, but it can be hard to digest without
      having lived it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ‘24 canvassing season, PV used money from many different
      buckets, having direct consequence on the day to day lives of those of us
      in the program. In this article, I'll break down the laws on paper, and
      share how they impacted our operations.

    <h4>
      <a id="_pemhwsiyslkw"></a>Fundraising is hard, except when it's soft
    </h4>
    <p>
      The entire goal of political fundraising laws is to prevent bribery and
      corruption. Nobody can give freely to a candidate - depending on which
      type of organization you are, different restrictions apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coordinated</strong> or <strong>Hard side</strong> organizations
        are able to freely coordinate directly with the candidate. However, they
        have extremely strict contribution limits - An individual can only
        donate a few thousand dollars to any hardside organization, and hardside
        organizations can only donate a few thousand dollars from one to
        another, each cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Independent</strong> or <strong>Soft side</strong> organizations
        were created in the wake of Citizens United, when it was determined that
        the campaign finance system placed an undue burden on freedom of speech,
        and it was decided that there was another way to achieve the goal of
        preventing bribery: Preventing coordination. These groups can take
        unlimited funding, but cannot coordinate directly with candidates.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Anytime you see massive fundraising numbers, you are looking at a
      soft-side org. These orgs can do basically whatever they want - put up
      yard signs, make movies, create and distribute messaging. But they
      <strong>cannot</strong> exchange <strong>strategic</strong>,
      <strong>non-public</strong> information with the campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few cheeky ways around this. Candidates cannot direct specific
      superpacs on what to do, but they can share public information for what
      they would want people who support them to do.
      “<strong>Redboxing</strong>” is the practice of drawing a gigantic red box
      around items on your campaign site that you want to draw your soft-side
      supporters attention to: Demographics that you want them to hit, messaging
      you want them to use, etc. Redboxing refers to any mechanism that publicly
      announces what you want superpacs to do.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_l21haku5oplb"></a>Comments on Committees</h4>
    <p>
      Committees are a general term for groups that are working to achieve
      political outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Party committees</strong> - most famously the “Democratic
        National Committee”, are the political parties we know and love. It is
        worth noting that the parties are not government entities - they are
        just groups of citizens working together to amass political power
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Candidate committees </strong>- A specific candidate's campaign.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Political Action Committees (PACs)</strong> - Any organization
        focused on political action is a PAC. Pacs are traditionally hard side
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Super PACS </strong>- Created after citizens united, these pacs
        are soft-side, and can accept unlimited contributions, but cannot
        coordinate with the other committees.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that any goods and services transferred from one org to
      another count as a contribution - If you buy a candidate a coffee or order
      your graphics guy to make a poster for a DNC event, these both count as
      contributions. Volunteer work you do in your individual capacity is
      protected free speech, and is never considered a contribution - but if you
      are exposed to non-public strategic information, and are a decision maker
      for an organization, this can still cause problems, so it is generally
      avoided.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_q46eq4h6ktl"></a>Spilling the Chari-Tea</h4>
    <p>
      Charities are groups that are working to make society better. They are
      intended to do this through means other than
      <strong>electoral politics</strong>, but because “everything is
      political”, they are a useful vehicle for political change. These orgs are
      more limited on the political activity they can engage in than super pacs,
      but are more tax advantaged. <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>501c(3) charities</strong>: These are standard charities, like
        UNICEF or the Red Cross. Generally, they stay totally out of politics.
        They cannot influence <strong>partisan electoral outcomes </strong>by,
        for example, declaring support for one candidate or buying yard signs.
        But they can spend “<strong>an insubstantial</strong>” (&lt;5%) portion
        of their budget <strong>lobbying </strong>politicians in office to
        change laws - for example, the red cross might advocate for better
        vaccine preparedness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>501c(4) social welfare organizations</strong>: These groups
        advocate for specific cause areas - for example, the NRA advocates for
        gun rights. They can spend up to 49% of their budget on
        <strong>partisan electoral outcomes</strong>, as long as the
        <strong>majority</strong> of their funds are spent elsewhere.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So long as you are not acting in a <strong>partisan </strong>fashion,
      (using the names of candidates or dates of elections in communications are
      big no-nos), you can speak freely about issues like drug decriminalization
      or election participation within your community as a c4 org. Additionally,
      once you reach that 51% non-partisan spending threshold, you can spend the
      rest of your budget on openly partisan messaging. If a large amount of
      spend is done early in the campaign season, like for a large GOTV event,
      it can get you closer to that 51% spend, and allow you to transition to
      more partisan messaging sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one more key property to charities. Donations to all PACs must be
      reported, and must be from US citizens. But anyone, including foreign
      nationals, can anonymously donate to c4 charities. This is referred to as
      “Dark Money” is a spooky loophole in politics. While c4s that accept
      foreign donations are absolutely banned from partisan electoral outcomes,
      they can participate in unlimited lobbying or work on ballot measures -
      votes for specific policy, as opposed to candidates.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_j85pzdrs2etx"></a>Bringing it all together - literally</h4>
    <p>
      Each of the different organizational structures we discussed has different
      benefits depending on your goals. Generally, you want to use the most
      tax-advantaged organization you are allowed to for your project if you are
      accepting mass donations, and may consider adjusting project scope to
      allow a more preferable structure to be used. But there is a way to have
      your cake and eat it too: You can use hybrid orgs to have separate “money
      buckets”, and pay for different parts of the project with different
      buckets to get the best of all worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also one more organization that we have not discussed: Freely
      associated citizens, enjoying their free speech protections to coordinate
      without spending any money, and hence without needing to worry about
      political finance regulations.

      My favorite such org is the DGG political action server, which you should
