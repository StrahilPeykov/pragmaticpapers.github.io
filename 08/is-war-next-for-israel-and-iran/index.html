      Eight days before what would become known as the Six Day War, Israeli
      prime minister Levi Eshkol would go onto the airwaves to try and reassure
      a wary country. In the days and weeks leading up to his broadcast,
      Egyptian forces had closed off the vital Straits of Tiran, evicted UN
      peacekeeping forces from the Sinai and moved their own armed forces into
      the region. Simmering resentments from the first Arab-Israeli had resulted
      in years long border disputes between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria. The
      unresolved Palestinian refugee dilemma mixed to create a tinderbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of Egyptian and Syrian aggression, Israel's prime minister had
      urged restraint and caution in dealing with the military threat and had
      elected to await the details of a joint American and British plan to
      reopen the straits. Eshkol, already then known for his weak public
      speaking skills, delivered a stumbling and disjointed speech due in part
      to exhaustion and an inadequately prepared script. The speech would see
      public morale plummet and Eshkol would be pilloried in public and in the
      press. Ze’ev Schiff, a then columnist for Ha’aretz would<a
        href="https://azure.org.il/article.php?id=248&amp;page=3"
      >
        exclaim</a
      >, “<em
        >It’s amazing how a people who suffered a Holocaust is willing to
        believe and endanger itself once again</em
      >.” Not long after, Eshkol would be forced to reorganize his cabinet and
      accept the creation of a unity government which included the political
      opposition. Eight days later, Israel would launch its preemptive war,
      devastating its Arab opponents and achieving a crushing victory.

      Although neither side actively desired war, and the major powers—the
      United States and the Soviet Union—worked to prevent it, the conflict
      ultimately unfolded. Israel, perceiving its core national interests to be
      at significant risk, found the assurances from its allies insufficient to
      mitigate the looming threat. Consequently, it determined that the danger
      was too severe to ignore and decided to initiate its offensive. Similarly,
      Israel sees its present situation vis a vis Iran as an overbearing
      national security threat particularly in light of the latter's<a
        href="https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/iran/"
      >
        relationship</a
      >
      with Hamas and Hezbollah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brutal attacks of October 7<sup>th </sup>ended what may have been a
      perception of invincibility and spurred Israel’s government and population
      to concentrate its consideration of where the existential threats to the
      Jewish state ultimately lie. And<a

      and actions, it is unclear if Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      will decide to give diplomacy a chance or decide to go down the same route
      as 1967, deciding to act on its own regardless of what some of its allies
      might counsel.

      In recent months, despite the ongoing conflicts with the three H’s:
      Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, Israel has grown increasingly vocal
      about the primary threat posed by Iran and its nuclear program. With
      Tehran’s uranium enrichment having<a
        href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlddd02w9jo"
      >
        approached</a
      >
      weapons-grade levels, Israeli leadership faces a stark question: wait for
      an irreversible nuclear threshold to be crossed or preemptively strike
      Iran's nuclear infrastructure. For Israel, the stakes are existential. The
      possibility of<a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-israel-would-be-the-leader-of-strike-on-iran-if-nuclear-talks-fall-apart/"
      >
        airstrikes</a
      >—either unilaterally or in coordination with the United States—is no
      longer a fringe scenario but a subject of active military preparation and
      political debate. From Israel's perspective, a nuclear Iran is not merely
      a strategic setback, but a potentially catastrophic development that could
      alter the regional balance of power irreversibly.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Israel views Iran’s nuclear ambitions through the lens of national
      survival. This perception is deeply rooted in Israeli security doctrine
      and historical memory. The "<a
        href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AEtherJournal/Journals/Volume-2_Number-4/Talbot.pdf"
        >Begin Doctrine</a
      >," articulated after Israel's 1981 strike on Iraq's Osirak reactor,
      establishes a precedent: Israel would not allow hostile regimes to acquire
      nuclear weapons. Iran’s ideological hostility, regional adventurism, and
      support for proxy militias such as Hezbollah and Hamas only deepen Israeli
      anxieties. The Islamic Republic's repeated threats against the Jewish
      state—whether rhetorical or material—reinforce the belief that allowing
      Tehran to become a nuclear threshold state would leave Israel vulnerable
      to coercion, or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collapse of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018,
      due entirely to Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the treaty,
      resulted in Iran’s subsequent ramp-up of uranium enrichment at facilities
      like Natanz and Fordow add further urgency to Jerusalem's calculus.

      The military option is fraught with<a
        href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/challenges-involved-military-strikes-against-irans-nuclear-programme"
      >
        challenges</a
      >, but Israel has made significant preparations. The Israeli Air Force has
      invested in long-range strike capabilities, including refueling aircraft,
      advanced munitions, and cyber warfare tools. Military drills simulating
      strikes on distant, hardened targets signal growing readiness. Still,
      Iran's nuclear infrastructure presents formidable obstacles. Key sites are
      fortified, dispersed, and in some cases buried deep underground. A single,
      decapitating strike is unlikely to eliminate the program entirely.
      Additionally, any such action would likely trigger a wider regional
      confrontation, potentially involving Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon,
      missile strikes from Iranian proxies in Iraq, and economic fallout in the
      form of oil price shocks. Israel must weigh the tactical benefits of a
      preemptive strike against the strategic risks of escalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of U.S. involvement further complicates Israel's
      decision-making. While Israeli officials stress their willingness to act
      alone, there is little doubt that coordination with Washington would
      significantly enhance operational effectiveness. U.S. capabilities in
      aerial refueling, intelligence sharing, and bunker-busting munitions could
      prove decisive. Yet the Trump administration has signaled caution,
      emphasizing<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-whats-at-stake.html"
      >
        diplomacy</a
      >
      while maintaining the rhetoric of "all options on the table.", going so
      far as to<a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-blocked-israeli-proposed-attack-on-iran-to-pursue-negotiated-nuclear-deal-report/"
      >
        block</a
      >
      a plans for a joint American/Israeli strike this coming May. For Israel,
      this ambiguity is a double-edged sword: it preserves deterrence by keeping
      Tehran guessing but also underscores the possibility that Jerusalem may
      have to<a
        href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/03/will-israel-and-the-united-states-diverge-on-iran/"
      >
        act</a
      >
      without American backing. From an Israeli strategic standpoint, the longer
      the U.S. remains indecisive, the greater the likelihood that Israel will
      be compelled to act unilaterally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestically, the prospect of a strike is politically complex but not
      necessarily divisive. While there is debate within Israel about the timing
      and consequences of such an action, there is broad<a
        href="https://www.jns.org/jns-poll-israeli-public-believes-now-is-the-time-to-attack-irans-nuclear-installations/"
      >
        consensus</a
      >
      across most of the political spectrum that a nuclear-armed Iran is
      unacceptable. The Israeli public, shaped by decades of conflict and the
      memory of existential threats, generally supports assertive measures when
      national security is at stake. Regionally, Israel would likely receive
      quiet backing from Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
      Emirates, which also view Iran’s nuclear program with<a
        href="https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2024/12/18/the-nuclear-kingdom-accessing-saudi-arabias-nuclear-behavior/"
      >
        alarm</a
      >. These states may not publicly endorse an Israeli strike but could
      provide logistical support or intelligence cooperation. On the
      international stage, Israel would have to brace for diplomatic fallout,
      especially from European allies and international institutions, but could
      mitigate criticism by emphasizing its right to self-defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Israel’s consideration of a potential strike on Iran may well not be a
      product of belligerence but of strategic necessity. Convinced that a
      nuclear Iran would upend the regional status quo and threaten its very
      existence, Israel seems prepared to act if it believes no other options
      remain. The window for diplomacy is narrowing, and with each passing day,
      the threshold for military action lowers. Whether Israel ultimately
      decides to launch a strike will depend on a complex combination of
      intelligence, diplomacy, and geopolitical timing—but from Jerusalem's
      vantage point, the clock is ticking.
