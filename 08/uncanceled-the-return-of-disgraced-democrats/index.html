      Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024 shocked democrats across the country.
      After all of the votes were counted, an analysis by the New York Times
      found that

      in America’s largest city and the surrounding New York metro area. Many
      counties in the region saw shifts of more than 5 percentage points,
      despite Trump being found

      on 34 felony counts of falsified business records. While the democratic
      party and their talking heads are busy trying to figure out what led to
      the collapse of the democratic coalition in 2024, two men who once loomed
      large over the New York metro are back. They are Jim McGreevey and Andrew
      Cuomo, the former governors of New Jersey and New York. Forced to resign
      in disgrace amidst allegations of corruption and sexual impropriety, they
      are running to be the next mayors of the sister cities at the mouth of the
      Hudson River, Jersey City and New York City. Despite a decade separating
      their falls from grace, both men faced similar political pressures as
      Trump, with allegations of sexual misconduct and corruption. Unlike Trump,
      they were unable to weather the storm and were ultimately forced to resign
      and pushed out of political life.

      Governor of New Jersey in 2001, with more than 50% of the vote, the first
      gubernatorial candidate to do so since 1990. Democrats were excited
      because even though Clinton carried New Jersey in both of his elections,
      New Jersey was still considered a swing state. However, by the summer of
      2004 he was facing threats of a
      <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=123479&amp;page=1"
        >sexual harassment lawsuit</a
      >
      from one of his former advisors, Golan Cipel. In an attempt to avoid the
      lawsuit, McGreevy held a press conference where, in addition to announcing
      his resignation effective November 15th of that year, he would go on to
      say
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRGVuHayJsg"
        >“And so my truth is that I am a gay American"</a
      >
      thus becoming the first openly gay governor in America. Then in 2005, one
      of his key fundraisers, David D’Amiato was
      <a

        >convicted</a

      of extortion of a farmer in Middlesex County for $40,000. The indictment
      included references to coordination with “State Official 1” who was later
      revealed as McGreevey himself. In the years since his resignation,
      McGreevey pursued

      spanning almost three decades. His continued upward ascent in the
      democratic party almost felt inevitable. As he reached the middle of his
      third term as governor in 2020, Trump abandoned any responsibility for
      leading the country through the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuomo stepped up and
      took the spotlight. He held

      With the collapse of the democratic coalition in the 2024 presidential
      election, the democratic party and its supporters are trying to chart a
      path to get the party back into power. Pundits have noted that there has
      been a
      <a href="https://youtu.be/Sx0J7dIlL7c?t=1344"
        >marked decline of support for the party by young men</a

        >didn’t feel they could trust the Biden administration</a

      especially after

      against Trump. Even diehard democratic voters have expressed that the
      party should

        >possibly avoid nominating women or minority candidates</a
      >
      for president in favor of whiter men, that the average American can relate
      to. This is the political landscape where Cuomo, and to a lesser extent,
      McGreevey can shine.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbaFAj3N-dY">McGreevey</a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KAoPAwlvrHM">Cuomo</a>, in their
      campaign announcement videos, start with acknowledging that their past
      behavior was wrong, but that they, like everyone else deserve a second
      chance. They also point out that there is something going wrong with
      government. Despite the fact that they were at one point part of the
      “establishment”, they’re leveraging that they were pushed out of politics
      publicly, to lend a sense of credibility to their claims of being an
      outsider. However, unlike other outsider candidates, they can point to
      their previous records in political office to show that they know how the
      system works and can get things done for working people. Additionally,
      Cuomo has made clear in interviews that he disagreed with the Biden
      administration in key areas, like the
      <a href="https://youtu.be/YTVx47qbOtY?t=3708">handling of the border</a>
      and
      <a href="https://youtu.be/YTVx47qbOtY?t=3964"
        >how they talked about Biden’s mental state and ability to run for
        re-election</a
      >. These are issues that many Biden to Trump voters claimed pushed them
      away from the democratic party. With mayoral primaries in both cities
      scheduled for June it might be too early to know if this strategy will
      work, but at the time of writing, both
      <a
        href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/poll-mcgreevey-leads-6-person-jersey-city-mayoral-race-34-of-respondents-unsure/"
        >McGreevey</a
      >
      and <a href="https://www.racetothewh.com/nycmayorpolling">Cuomo</a> are
      the leading candidates in their respective races and it’s not even close.
      However, as the election dates approach and more voters focus on these
      races, the polls might start to shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      If McGreevey and Cuomo are elected as mayors this fall, it would mark a
      shift in the Democratic Party. America's largest metro, with deeply
      entrenched democratic party politics, will have elected democratic mayors,
      but rejected the “wokescold” and “cancel culture” views of the 2010’s.
      Their victories could be a beacon in the fog. Maybe they can help the
      democratic party find its way and mount a strong offensive against Trump
      and the MAGA republicans in 2026 without acquiescing to the far left
      fringe of the Democratic Party.
