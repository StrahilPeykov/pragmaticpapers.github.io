    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>EO 14256 – Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid
      Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value
      Imports</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">

        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      This EO relies on the
      <a
        href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82"
        >International Economic Emergency Powers Act</a
      >
      (the “IEEPA”), the
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&amp;edition=prelim"
        >National Emergencies Act</a
      >
      (the “NEA”), the
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf"
        >Trade Act of 1974 § 604</a
      >, and
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:3%20section:301%20edition:prelim)"
        >3 USC 301</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1 claims that Chinese companies ship illicit substances to the US
      via small shipments that avoid detection due to the
      <em>de minimis </em>exception under 321(a)(2)(C) of the
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title19/chapter4&amp;edition=prelim"
        >Tariff Act of 1930</a
      >. Per
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02408/imposing-duties-to-address-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china"
        >EO 14195</a
      >, the tariffs on China are specifically to combat synthetic opioids from
      entering the US. The Secretary of Commerce has reported that systems are
      now in place for tariffing such <em>de minimis </em>shipments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 applies the tariff to shipments that would have previously
      enjoyed the <em>de minimis </em>exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to take all necessary
      actions to implement this EO.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This closes the de minimis loophole that has existed since 1930 for
      shipments from China. In the past this was largely for simple
      non-commercial shipments between the countries, but in recent years has
      been used by drop shippers and companies like TEMU to make fortunes. With
      its closing, there now will be high duties, not just Trump’s tariffs, on
      these products coming into America.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img class="invertphoto" src="/uploads/08/temu.png" alt="Image 1" />
    </div>
    <p>
      On April 17th, TEMU and Shein announced price increases due to “changes in
      global trade rules”
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While it is fun to laugh at drop shippers, this will negatively affect a
      number of other businesses in America, Chinese residents in America, and
      raise prices on any number of products in America that have become
      accessible and inexpensive in the last few years.

    <h3>EO 14257 – Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade
        Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States
        Goods Trade Deficits</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-07/pdf/2025-06063.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This EO relies on the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, the
      National Emergencies Act, the Trade Act of 1974 § 604, and 3 USC 301.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a very long and nonsensical preamble that talks about how hard it
      is to be the US in the world economy, it fails to mention how much better
      the US economy has been doing over the last four years under Biden in
      comparison to other nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1 declares a national emergency due to the rising trade deficits
      that occur between the US and their trade partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 imposes tariffs on the countries listed in Annex 1 starting at
      10% and increasing as stated.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3 requires the tariffs be implemented by April 5, 2025.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 requires the Secretary of Commerce and other officers within the
      executive to recommend additional actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 requires these same officials to take all necessary legal steps
      to implement these tariffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 requires the offices stated to provide reports to congress
      regarding the national emergency.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is the big tariff EO that has been in the news non-stop since it was
      signed. The Trump admin has imposed horrific tariffs on countries for no
      real purpose or gain to the US. By declaring a national emergency under
      the National Emergencies Act the Administration presumes to be able to
      impose tariffs as they see fit. This is despite no previous administration
      ever employing these laws in this way. National emergencies under this act
      are almost always specific and any powers employed done so narrowly with a
      specific goal.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      There are a number of articles providing in depth economic analysis in
      almost every news outlet, including the Pragmatic Papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If challenged in court, the tariffs have little in the way of legal
      support. As mentioned above this is a novel application of both the NEA
      and IEEPA. The Administration is applying broad, essentially random,
      tariffs that have no real relation to the “emergencies” they allege.
      Additionally, none of the “emergencies” that have been identified are
      specific, unique, or ones that are directly related to the powers
      employed. It would not be surprising to see a court attempt to block such
      tariffs, though with the Administration’s recent actions in mind, it is
      unclear if this will be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are currently two relevant lawsuits I am aware of, one out of
      <a
        href="https://www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-china-tariffs-florida-company-lawsuit-imports-2058109"
        >Florida</a
      >
      for tariffs specifically against china, and another out of
      <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FILE_8502.pdf"
        >California</a
      >
      regarding the tariffs generally. While both are with solid argument and
      law behind them, they may not be fast enough to prevent serious economic
      harm on an international scale.

    <h3>EO 14258 – Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 amends
      <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-02087.pdf"
        >EO 14166</a
      >
      - Application of Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled
      Applications Act to TikTok, to extend the sale deadline of TikTok to June
      19, 2025.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This provides another 90 days for TikTok to either leave or find a
      domestic buyer.
    </p>

        Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images files</span>
    </div>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      In 90 days TikTok will either be bought, leave, or Trump will extend the
      deadline another 90 days.
