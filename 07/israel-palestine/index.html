    <p>
      In the three weeks since our last update on Israel/Palestine, the
      conditions on the ground in Gaza have not improved in the slightest. With
      no end to the conflict in sight, will we see a change in the status quo?
      Or are the wishes of Israel’s far right government officials doomed to
      come true? Let’s take a look at some of the key events that have occurred
      since we last took a look.

    <h4>March 23 – Medic Massacre</h4>

      >
      of Rafah, in southern Gaza. The dead included eight
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Red_Crescent_Society"
        >Red Crescent</a
      >
      workers (think Red Cross), six members of Gaza’s
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Civil_Defence"

      emergency unit and a staffer from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA">UNRWA</a>, the U.N.’s agency
      for Palestinians. According to the UN, Israel then buried the bodies and
      ambulances in an impromptu mass grave and
      <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161721"
        >restricted access to the burial site for five days</a
      >. Initially,

        >Israel’s assessment stated</a
      >
      that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing
      suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”
      and that they had killed 9 militants, including Hamas operative Amin
      Shobaki. That narrative began to fall apart after no one matching that
      name was among the bodies, and completely shattered when video showing the

        >behavior was completely normal</a
      >. Israel’s promises to continue investigating fell on deaf ears, as the

        >claims that one medic is still missing</a
      >, and as far as I can tell, Israel hasn’t acknowledged these claims as of
      yet.

    <h4>March 25 – Protests in Gaza</h4>

    <p>
      Protests broke out all around the Gaza Strip as Palestinians voiced their
      criticisms of the militant group in a
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-protest-public-opinion-c81e9684f14d5d00b23b13a3d337389b"
        >rare public showing of dissent</a
      >. The protests began a day after Islamic Jihad gunmen launched rockets
      into Israel, which was then met with an

        >Israeli order to evacuate</a
      >
      the city of Beit Lahia. This sparked anger in the area, and thousands took
      to the streets. Most were

      which has claimed over

        >50,000 lives since October 7th, 2023</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h4>April 2 – New Offensive Announced</h4>

    <p>
      A major escalation came when Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz
      formally announced a military occupation of Gaza, citing the need to
      <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/03/israel-military-occupation-gaza-ceasefire?"
        >neutralize Hamas infrastructure</a
      >. Netanyahu also announced that Israel is
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-gaza-operation-04-02-2025-6b653fc8fa1e6f0c1a0c8d322bd48ccc"
        >establishing a new security corridor</a
      >, named the Morag Corridor, after a jewish settlement that used to be
      near Rafah. Katz urged Gazans to eliminate Hamas and stated the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-expands-military-operation-gaza-defence-minister-says-2025-04-02/"
        >return of Israeli hostages</a
      >
      is the only way to end the war, as this offensive is a continuation of
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahu-vows-pressure-hamas-after-ceasefire-proposal-2025-03-30/"
        >Israel’s increased pressure</a
      >
      on the militant group. However, Katz's statement did not make clear how
      much land Israel intends to seize or whether the move represented a
      permanent annexation of territory, muddying an already unclear future for
      Palestinians. As of the time of this writing,<a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-remaining-hostages-gaza-dbedb436b04fac1c790a794a4ef03853"
      >
        59 hostages remain in Gaza</a
      >, and it’s expected that 35 of those hostages are dead.

    <h4>April 4 – Shuja’iyya Ground Offensive Begins</h4>

    <p>
      Israeli forces launched a full-scale offensive in Shuja’iyya, a densely
      populated neighborhood in Gaza City. This marked the third ground
      incursion of the year, as troops pushed further into Gaza in an attempt to
      “<a
        href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250404-israel-expands-ground-offensive-in-gaza"
        >expand the security zone</a
      >”. Israel ordered for the evacuation of the area and initially reported
      success,
      <a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-widens-ground-operation-in-northern-gaza-kills-senior-hamas-official-in-lebanon/"
        >taking out a Hamas command center</a
      >
      and several terrorists. However, days later on April 9th, Israel would
      take out a residential building, killing
      <a
        href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/4/9/live-israel-pounds-gaza-closes-unrwa-schools-in-occupied-east-jerusalem"
        >roughly 30 civilians</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-849690"
        >injuring 70 more</a
      >. Israel claimed it took out Haitham Razek abd al-Karim Sheikh Khalil, a
      commander in Hamas's Shejaiya battalion and participant in the attacks on
      October 7th. While Israel has provided the information of the
      <a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1910314386859622676">Hamas operatives</a
      >, these claims are yet to be verified by Hamas themselves.
    </p>

    <h4>April 12 – Rafah Encircled; Promised Expansion</h4>

    <p>
      Israeli forces sealed off Rafah, closing the Morag Axis and completing the
      encirclement of the southern city. “<a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-morag-12-04-2025-a5bda630b3e37d3b9431cce1bd8f2fdd"
        >Activity will expand rapidly</a
      >
      to additional locations throughout most of Gaza and you will have to
      evacuate the fighting zones,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a
      statement, without saying where Palestinians were meant to go. This is a
      developing story, with Israel launching airstrikes Sunday morning, hitting
      one of the last<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o">
        fully functional hospitals</a
      >
      in Gaza. While the future is uncertain,
      <a

        >Israel has made their intentions clear</a
      >; they are not slowing down.
