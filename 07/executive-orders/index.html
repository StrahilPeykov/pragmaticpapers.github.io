    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>EO 14250 – Addressing Risks From WilmerHale</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05845.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 27, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <p>
      This EO is almost identical to
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-11/pdf/2025-03989.pdf"
        >EO 14230</a
      >. It is an attack on a big law firm in America in hopes of receiving
      concessions. At this point the Administration has gotten over
      <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/11/trump-law-firms-deals-orders/"
        >$600 million in pro bono publico legal services</a
      >. WilmerHale, like Perkins Coie, is showing that they refuse to
      participate in this corrupt dance, and have
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/jenner-block-trump-filing.html"
        >decided to fight</a
      >. As with the multiple other EOs prior to this, it is shameful and should
      be condemned by all.

    <h3>
      EO 14251 – Exclusions From Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05836.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 27, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      This EO claims to be derived from powers granted under
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7103"
        >5 USC 7103(b)(1)</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/4103"
        >22 USC 4103(b)</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 1 states that the agencies listed in this EO have a primary
      function in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national
      security work. It states that
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title5/part3/subpartF/chapter71&amp;edition=prelim"
        >5 USC 71</a
      >
      cannot be applied to these agencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 amends
      <a
        href="https://archives.federalregister.gov/issue_slice/1979/11/20/66563-66566.pdf"
        >EO 12171</a
      >
      to add a long list of executive departments and agencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 amends EO 12171 to include subdivisions of executive departments
      and agencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 4 delegates authority to the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans
      affairs to bring the departments and agencies listed in EO 12171, as
      amended, under the coverage of the
      <a
        href="https://www.flra.gov/resources-training/resources/statute-and-regulations/statute"
        >Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 5 removes the Department of Transportation’s requirement to
      negotiate with unions.
    </p>

    <p>Section 6 requires agencies to no longer hire or negotiate unions.</p>

    <p>
      Section 7 requires reporting of compliance to the President by each agency
      head.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      Taken holistically this removes the ability of federal workers in almost,
      if not, all large agencies to collectively bargain and form unions. 5 USC
      71 recognizes the right of public employees to form and participate in
      unions. The Administration, as it was previously, is very anti union and
      anti worker. While repealing 5 USC 71 is not within the power of the
      executive, they will try to limit its reach as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      Unions of public employees are some of the strongest and oldest in our
      nation. They often are cited for the reason for government bloat and
      inefficiency, though this is largely conservative propaganda. Most
      recently many have led the charge against the Administration’s illegal
      firings of federal employees. This EO serves as a two for one deal,
      attacking some of the most active and powerful unions in our nation while
      also helping facilitate the denuding of our government.
    </p>

      <span class="caption">Nathan Posner/Getty Images</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      With regards to any legal challenge to this EO, there is a question as to
      whether this EO can retroactively dissolve unions and collective
      bargaining agreements in place. At worst it can, though it may just
      prevent new employees from joining and prevent any future negotiations
      with these unions. Hopefully it will fail under judicial scrutiny, though
      it is not clear if this EO is outside of the scope of the President’s
      powers.

    <h3>EO 14252 – Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05837.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 27, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 is a bunch of masturbatory language about how Americans deserve
      to have a beautiful capital city.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 states that it is the policy of the US to make DC pretty, fight
      crime, and have pretty monuments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 creates the Safe and Beautiful Task Force to coordinate with
      various federal law enforcement agencies to enforce federal policies to
      fight crime in DC.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 4 requires the Secretary of the Interior, of Transportation, and
      the US Attorney of DC to take steps to make DC pretty, and evict all the
      homeless.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO serves two purposes. First to expand the powers and resources of
      law enforcement in DC. As any resident of DC will tell you, it is one of
      the most active cities when it comes to protests, especially during Donald
      Trump’s regimes. By empowering law enforcement, it is likely that the
      Administration will suppress any anti-MAGA protests in the capitol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, beautification of the capitol. This language is largely cover for
      the true purpose of evicting homeless people from DC and preparing it for
      the military parades that are likely to come.
    </p>

      <img src="/uploads/07/policemilitary.png" alt="Image 2" />
      <span class="caption">Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span>
    </div>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      We should expect far harsher and less constitutional actions by DC police.
      It will likely result in only pro-MAGA demonstrations in the capitol and
      touted as evidence of hard on crime policies being superior. DC will
      likely become a testing ground for future authoritarian actions deployed
      by the Administration in conjunction with law enforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
      As far as legality, this EO faces challenges with regards to the evicting
      of homeless persons in DC. DC has strong laws protecting the homeless and
      provides many resources for their homeless population. These laws cannot
      be countermanded by an EO, and while the homeless have far less resources
      than the federal government, it is likely that actions taken under this EO
      will violate their rights and could lead into serious costs to the
      American taxpayer.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14253 – Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05838.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 27, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 is upset that people learned that racism existed in the past,
      and that historical figures and actions taken by America do not hold up to
      modern standards of morality. It goes on to complain that America is not
      race realist enough, and should really stop pushing the ideological
      revisionist history about black people having a less good time than white
      people in America’s past and present. It goes on for more than a whole
      page and is really cringe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 has a lot of vague language that amounts to making sure black
      history, trans history, and any historical facts about the immoral actions
      of american historical figures or America are no longer featured in the
      Smithsonian or other federally owned or funded museums or places of
      learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of the Interior to fund an improvement of
      infrastructure for Independence park by July 4th, 2026 the 250th
      anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 4 requires changes to monuments under federal control made during
      the Biden Administration be restored to their former (read “Confederate”)
      glory.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is largely in line with the Administration’s policy of attacking
      any progressive policy or ideologies. It removes both minority and trans
      visibility in American history. It provides some funding for getting ready
      for likely an incredibly gaudy celebration of our nation’s 250th
      anniversary. Finally it returns the names of confederate and other
      detestable figures in history that had previously been stripped to
      monuments, buildings, and military bases.

      >
    </div>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This from the category of EO that plays to the social/identity politics
      crowd within the MAGA base. It attacks minorities and trans people while
      also promoting racist ideas and morally reprehensible figures in American
      history that are glorified by conservatives and MAGAts. While this EO is
      itself not as impactful as others, it is maybe one of the best examples of
      the ideological rot at the center of conservatives. I don’t say MAGA here
      because these sentiments and historical revisionism have existed within
      conservative parties since reconstruction. This EO, among an uncountable
      number of other actions of this crowd, must not be forgotten, so that
      someday we can forever put them in our own history.

    <h3>
      EO 14254 – Combating Unfair Practices in the Live Entertainment Market
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05906.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 31, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 complains about scalpers in the live entertainment industry.
    </p>

    <p>Section 2 directs the FTC and AG to go after scalpers.</p>

    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of the Treasury to provide an
      implementation report within 180 days.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This largely just directs the government to enforce laws that are already
      on the books to go after a target that was already in the crosshairs of
      the government.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is happy to gloss over Trump’s attack on
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-fires-both-democratic-commissioners-ftc-sources-say-2025-03-18/"
        >the FTC and its impartiality</a
      >. It is likely that we will see some kind of press release or talking
      point about this EO in the future to try and show that the Administration
      is fighting for the average person. There also likely will be some false
      claim of victory, and going forward MAGAts will claim that now scalping at
      these events is no longer an issue.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14255 – Establishing the United States Investment Accelerator</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-03/pdf/2025-05908.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed: March 31, 2025, published: April 3, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 bemoans the burden of regulation on the American economy. It is
      apparently especially true for the construction industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 states that it is the policy of the US to modernize its
      processes to attract investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 creates the Office of the United States Investment Accelerator.
      It orders the Accelerator to facilitate and accelerate investments above
      $1 billion in the US to navigate the US regulatory processes, reduce
      regulatory burdens, increase access to and use of national resources,
      facilitate research collaborations, and work with the state governments.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is incredibly vague in its meaning. While explicitly it creates an
      office to help parties with large amounts of money to invest in the US, it
      doesn’t give enough specifics to know how that office will operate.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      The creation of the Investment Accelerator should be read with the many
      statements made by the President and his Administration about the ever
      growing amount of money to be invested in America. At the time of writing,
      it is reported as being over $7 trillion. It may be that this position
      will help these large investments quickly navigate the US regulatory
      system and result in rapid implementation to the American economy. More
      likely, this is a position to extract the correct take for the President
      and any cronies that require compensation for “assisting” with
      “navigating” the US regulatory system. If a person or entity is investing
      such vast sums in America they have the funds to navigate the regulatory
      system. By installing a new gatekeeper for such investments, the
      Administration can make sure the investment is not “burdened” by
      investment. Further, the Administration can now control these investments
      to punish and reward the parts of America that it favors or disfavors. As
      with almost every EO being signed these days, this one is likely only
      going to result in more graft and corruption from the executive.
    </p>

      <img src="/uploads/07/billionaires.png" alt="Image 4" />
      <span class="caption">Saul Loeb/Pool via REUTERS</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      Interestingly, though concerningly may be a better word, the EO places the
      <a
        href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/white-house-wraps-chips-office-into-new-us-investment-accelerator/"
        >CHIPS office under the Investment Accelerator</a
      >. The target of the act was to have over $52 billion in investments in
      domestic microchip production. Last year the office oversaw over $30
      billion alone. Now these funds will be approved, or not approved, by a
      Trump appointee. This gives Donald Trump direct control over one of the
      largest symbols of Joe Biden’s legacy.
