      For years, you’ve grinded away at community organizing. Making posters,
      drawing people to rallies, knocking on doors – You even got a few
      discussions on their local radio. Finally, you earned a position as a
      staffer working with your State Senator. In their office, you are pained
      to watch your boss make a deal with the devil every day – taking you on
      was one such deal. You don’t perfectly align politically, and your boss
      can smell the contempt you have for their corruption – but they had no
      better options. And soon, their seat will be yours – you are in an
      unchallenged blue+20 district. Your resolve is unfaltering, your morality
      is unswerving: You smirk to yourself, confident that you will do what none
      of the corrupt politicians before you have had the courage to: You are
      going to push the make everything better button.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big day comes before you know it. You wake up in the morning, don your
      finest suit, and walk into your new office. You ring up Hillary Rodham
      Clinton: “Hey Hilldawg, I would like to press the– Wait, what’s the sigh
      for? I just wanted to press the– What do you mean why do they always do
      this? What are you – WHAT?
      <strong><em>How could there not be a button</em></strong
      >?”

      Furious that Clinton (known Zionist) chose to hide the button from you,
      you resort to your backup plan. You draft the loyal citizens of
      Middleborough, MA, to form a citizens’ militia to fight against the
      terror-state of Israel yourself. You freeze everyone’s rents so their
      homes are waiting for them when they get back and mandate a diet of Sabra
      to all citizens so that they may better know their enemy. As you near the
      gates of the Mediterranean, your citizens begin to contract scurvy due to
      the lack of vitamin C in Sabra, so you ban scurvy. You die of scurvy.

    <h4>The Pros of Powerlessness</h4>

    <p>
      Having no power is a fantastic luxury. You can believe whatever you want,
      untested and without consequence. Is the new front in the eternal war
      between good and evil taking place between gamers and the woke? Sounds
      about right! How likely is it that the elites of the world are all
      conspiring together, and you really are the only one who knows the real
      truth? Why not 100%? Why not 1000%? And you have probably already noticed
      this, but in case you haven’t thought about it in a while, you have been
      totally in the right in every disagreement you have ever had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Achieving excellence in some domain is one of the most rewarding
      experiences available to us, but there is an alternative path to achieve
      this experience: reality denial. There seem to be few reasons for someone
      with no power or responsibilities to dance with the delusions described
      above, to daydream and explore them. But the longer they indulge in
      grandeur and fancy, with no tests, trade-offs, or consequences, the more
      deeply you believe your delusions. The more corrupted by them you become.
    </p>

    <h4>The Purifying Fire of Power</h4>

    <p>
      It is a tradition as old as time to imagine oneself plucked from their
      circumstances and dropped into a life of incredible excess – to dream of
      getting rich quick. For most, it remains an idle daydream, but millions of
      people every year will put real work, effort, money, and power into some
      scam or shitcoin. They will, inevitably, lose what they earned, and they,
      having paid their toll to truth, will abandon their folly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Power doesn’t corrupt; it amplifies. It is a force multiplier on all of
      your existing vices, and it ensures that all of your convictions are
      tested, each and every one. Power is the capacity to inflict dire
      consequences, but also the power to learn from them, to become a more
      worthy wielder of it. Assuming you are sufficiently reasonable and
      responsive to the needs of your constituents, it makes you better, not
      worse. And if you fail to do so, it casts you aside – power seeks those
      worthy of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Power seeks you. It yearns for you. Humility blights too many of the best
      of us, stunting our ambition. Do not fear power; fear a life of hollow
      delusion. Do not fear consequences; fear being rotted away by untested
      conviction. Seek power madly, recklessly, and unflinchingly. Take on
      whatever responsibility you can, wherever you can, as soon as you can –
      and learn what you can from it.
