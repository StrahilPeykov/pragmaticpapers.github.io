      To be perfectly honest, I didn’t know what I was expecting at the first
      meeting. I was coming fresh off of my local Democrats meeting the night
      before, and “rough” would be putting it nicely. Imagine 10 people in a
      room, all lamenting the situation. The highlight of the night was a lady
      announcing she was leaving the party due to a poor experience running for
      office. And then it just ended. No reassurances, no direction, no hope. If
      the opposition party couldn’t get people interested, what was I to expect
      of a random meeting announced on Nextdoor?
    </p>

    <p>
      I showed up and the difference was immediate. With nearly 50 people in
      attendance, we had to be moved to a bigger room. And like I said, this was
      off Nextdoor. This isn’t your typical political crowd. It’s everyday,
      normal Americans spurred to action. We might not have the experience, but
      we have the energy, and right now that’s more than enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went around the room and introduced everyone. Who were you, and why
      were you here? Every conceivable base was covered: the economy, DOGE,
      foreign affairs, immigration. You name it, we spoke about it. From the
      varied answers, a clear throughline emerged. Whether it’s for their
      family, their country, or themselves; people are scared.
    </p>

    <p>
      I approached the main organizer, Jill Kelly, at the end of the meeting and
      offered to help right away. It was apparent she was overwhelmed, as I was,
      at the amount of people who showed up. We arranged to get coffee that
      weekend to discuss what to do moving forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we met, we got to talking about the things that were worrying us
      personally. Jill is one of those people that you can tell just really care
      about people—the type of person who tears up when they see someone being
      hurt, someone needing help. For me, seeing the rhetoric and actions around
      immigration are personal. My girlfriend and her family immigrated during
      Trump’s first term. She’s Filipino, and we live in an area that’s
      predominantly white. What’s to stop ICE from arresting her and shipping
      her off without a court date? We have a few meat processing plants nearby
      that employ a ton of illegal immigrants, we’re a key spot for ICE to hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      After we got done sharing our personal stories, we started to hammer out
      what we wanted our coalition to look like. Being that we live in a red
      district, our group couldn’t be composed of one particular ideology. There
      are going to be people who voted for Trump and are now seeing the error of
      their ways, and both Jill and I agreed we want to be welcoming to those
      with a change of heart. We also want to provide a community for people to
      help each other out during these trying times. These are our neighbors,
      and that sense of community is needed now more than ever. And we want to
      inform people of what’s going on. It’s tempting to keep your head in the
      sand, but this administration is going to affect everyone. Lastly, and
      most importantly, we want to resist what’s happening, whether it be
      through protests, town halls, or other means. We have to do everything we
      can to stop what’s happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like I said previously, we live in a red district, and that makes things
      difficult. Our representative, Tom Emmer, is the GOP whip, making him the
      number three Republican in the House. A lot of people assume our area is a
      lost cause, so we don’t get a lot of attention or support from the state
      party. I can’t really blame them, most people have to hide that they’re
      Democrats here. I decided not to hide that fact, and I’m in the trenches
      every lunch break at the factory. We’re in the minority, and Republicans
      make sure that you know it at every opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      That reality is what led us to decide to have a protest. There ARE
      Democrats in the area. We need to let them know they’re not alone. Thanks
      to some press coverage, both
      <a

      and

        >national</a
      >, we had nearly 300 people show up for our first protest. I can’t begin
      to tell you how many people stopped and told us how amazed they were that
      there were people here who cared. Jill and I knew then that the protests
      weren’t going to stop. If we accomplished nothing more than making people
      feel less isolated, we’d have accomplished something worthwhile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, Jill and I find ourselves leading a rapidly growing grassroots
      movement. Neither of us has experience running an organization of this
      scale, and the learning curve is steep. But every meeting—filled with
      dozens of engaged community members—and every protest—echoing with the
      honks of supportive drivers—fuels our determination to continue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last Democratic party meeting had three times the attendance of the
      last meeting, and I was approached about taking over the chair seat of our
      local party unit. It’s becoming clear that this movement is serious. I’ve
      had a dozen meetings with people eager to get involved, and we all agree:
      this time is different. This time, we can’t afford to sit back and wait
      for the next election cycle to play out. The threats we face are too
      immediate, too urgent.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are now coordinating efforts among ten different resistance groups,
      each bringing unique strengths to the table. The sense of hope is
      undeniable. We are organizing, mobilizing, and most importantly, refusing
      to back down. The fight ahead is daunting, but together, we are proving
      that even in the most challenging districts, resistance is not futile—it
      is necessary. The energy is there, just waiting for someone to harness it.
      Are you going to step up? Or be stepped on? The choice is entirely yours.
