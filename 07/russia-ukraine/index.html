      Sunday, April 6, 2025, brought yet another round of
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/ukraine-kyiv-attack-russia.html"
        >Russia’s</a
      >
      barbaric strikes on Ukrainian residential areas—this time zeroing in on
      Kyiv with the capital’s largest air assault in weeks. Ballistic and cruise
      missiles mixed with swarms of drones screamed overhead, with the attack
      even forcing Poland to scramble fighter jets when objects edged toward its
      air‑defense zone, in hopes of avoiding a repeat of the fatal Przewodów
      mishap in 2022. The Kyiv barrage came barely 48 hours after Friday’s
      strike on Kryvyi Rih that killed 19 and wounded 74; a U.N. team has since
      confirmed: “that a meeting of beauticians, not military personnel, had
      been underway at a nearby restaurant” in regards to the said attack.

    <p>
      On Monday, <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-acknowledges-ukrainian-troops-were-present-russias-belgorod-region-2025-04-07/#:~:text=,to%20where%20it%20came%20from"
        >Zelenskyy</a
      >
      publicly confirmed something I noted a few weeks ago: the Ukrainian
      advance into Russia’s Belgorod region. The incursion had been an open
      secret—OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) watchers flagged it in late March,
      and even
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-belgorod.html"
        >The New York Times</a
      >
      commented on the push. Zelenskyy’s messaging remains clear: these
      cross‑border assaults aim to “reduce pressure on other frontline sectors,
      particularly in Donetsk,” and, so far, that logic tracks. While Russia has
      clawed back a chunk of the Kursk region, Ukraine still holds a valuable
      buffer zone there and flatly denies Kremlin claims that it lost key
      settlements such as Basivka.

      Tuesday, the biggest story spreading across the internet was the emergence
      of videos and reports confirming that two
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/zelensky-russia-chinese-belgorod.html"
        >Chinese nationals</a
      >
      had been captured in Ukraine’s Donetsk region—claims that President
      Zelenskyy later verified personally on social media. To many, this wasn’t
      exactly surprising—this war has drawn in a significant number of foreign
      fighters on both sides, and rumors of
      <a href="https://x.com/JayinKyiv/status/1909591410304491883">Chinese</a>
      nationals fighting for Russia have circulated for quite some time. Still,
      the confirmed capture is big news, as it gives Ukraine a rare opportunity
      to apply pressure on China—who has long claimed neutrality in the conflict
      while continuing to provide Moscow with economic support. What was
      surprising, though, was
      <a
        href="https://kyivindependent.com/trump-slams-russian-bombing-of-ukraine-calls-attacks-crazy/#:~:text=U,Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20on%20April%207"
        >Trump</a
      >
      taking the risk of upsetting his friends in the Kremlin—publicly stating,
      “I’m not happy about what’s going on with the bombing because they’re
      bombing like crazy right now. They’re bombing — I don’t know what’s
      happening there,” in reference to the Sunday strike on Kyiv and the
      earlier attack on Kryvyi Rih that killed nine children. Not exactly strong
      words from our fearless leader, but hey—I'm honestly surprised he said
      anything at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Wednesday, Russia decided to respond to Trump’s weak hand-wringing the
      way one might expect: by stepping up
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/europe/russia-ukraine-trump-war-analysis-intl/index.html"
        >offensive operations</a
      >
      across nearly every front line in Ukraine. Fighting intensified near
      Pokrovsk and along the border of Dnipropetrovsk, with Ukrainian officials
      warning that Putin’s troops are pushing for a symbolic foothold in a new
      region. It’s unclear whether this is the start of the long-feared spring
      offensive or just more of Russia’s standard meat-grinder tactics, but
      either way, the message is clear—they’re not particularly worried about
      upsetting Trump.
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/asia/china-ukraine-russia.html"
        >Zelenskyy</a
      >, meanwhile, focused on the Chinese nationals, doubling down on his claim
      that over 150 Chinese nationals are actively fighting for Russia.
      President Zelenskyy began sharing footage of captured fighters and calling
      it further proof that Beijing, while not directly deploying troops, is at
      least aware of the situation of which Beijing outright dismissed the
      entire claim as groundless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thursday saw the regathering of the so-called
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europeans-discuss-ukraine-peace-force-big-questions-unanswered-2025-04-10/"
        >Coalition of the Willing</a
      >—the same 30 countries that have been popping up in these weekly
      summaries—this time convening in Brussels to discuss the proposed
      “Reassurance Force.” The plan, as it stands, would see primarily UK and
      French troops deployed to secure parts of Ukraine in the event a peace
      deal is actually reached—an outcome still nowhere in sight. European
      defense ministers stressed the force would be designed to deter future
      Russian aggression, but also admitted that major questions remain: what
      the mission actually entails, where troops would be stationed, and whether
      the U.S. plans to help at all. Trump, as usual, has declined to offer any
      commitments beyond vague encouragement. European officials are trying to
      show they’re “ready to step up,” but without American logistical and
      intelligence support, it’s unclear whether this is a serious security
      plan.

    <p>
      On Friday, April 11, 2025, Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff,
      met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg for over four
      hours to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire. Despite the lengthy
      in-person meeting—and the series of awkward hand gestures
      <a href="https://x.com/nexta_tv/status/1910705876731568537">Witkoff</a>
      offered up—no real breakthrough occurred, and so far, there’s nothing
      concrete to show for it. The talks seemed more like an optics play than a
      serious negotiation, with both sides maintaining their usual vagueness.
      The lack of progress even forced
      <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114319592702753512"
        >Trump</a
      >
      to take to social media once again—only this time, rather than offering
      any real criticism of Putin, he defaulted back to his usual narrative:
      that the war wasn’t Russia’s fault, but somehow the result of U.S.
      failures and everyone else’s mistakes. In some good news though,
      <a
        href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/11/battle-for-pokrovsk-ukraines-military-says-it-has-pushed-back-russian-soldiers?utm_source"
        >Ukrainian forces</a
      >
      near Pokrovsk reported they’ve not only held the line but are now actively
      pushing Russian troops back—marking a rare momentum shift in what has been
      a grinding, nine-month-long battle for the key logistics hub. As one
      battalion commander put it: “Are we holding them? We are. Are we pushing
      them? We are pushing. Are we advancing? We are.” It’s not a victory yet,
      but after weeks of diplomatic deadlock and drone strikes, it’s at least a
      step in the right direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-scores-drones-ukraine-four-people-injured-kyiv-says-2025-04-12/"
        >Russia</a
      >
      capped off the week with another overnight drone barrage, launching 88
      drones across Ukraine and injuring four people, including three in Kyiv.
      While Ukrainian air defenses shot down 56 and jammed another 24, the
      strikes and remnants still managed to destroy homes and ignite fires in
      multiple cities—including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro. The timing couldn’t
      be more on-brand: just a day after Trump’s envoy left Moscow with no deal
      in hand,<a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/12/russia-ukraine-strikes-00287639"
      >
        Russian and Ukrainian</a
      >
      officials showed up at a conference in Turkey and spent the day accusing
      each other of violating the so-called 30-day limited ceasefire. Russia,
      naturally, claims it's been on its best behavior while sharing “evidence”
      of 60 Ukrainian infractions with U.S. and Turkish officials. Ukraine fired
      back with its own stats: over 2,200 exploding drones, 70 missiles, and
      6,000 guided bombs launched by Russia—since the limited ceasefire began.
