    <h4>The very real boycott against Tesla Motors.</h4>

      Elon Musk’s quick rise to grand vizier of the Trump court has brought with
      it the ire of almost every corner of the public. Whether he’s annoying

      >
      incurring investigation by the Canadian government, Musk just can’t catch
      a break. His two flagship companies, SpaceX and Tesla, appear to have
      similar luck. His most recent
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacex-launches-eighth-starship-test-eyeing-ships-mock-satellite-deployment-2025-03-06/"

        >in almost every region they are sold</a
      >. Whether this is the reckoning of long term trends coalescing in an
      inevitable outcome, or a public response to Musk’s actions within the US
      government, and foreign politics, is up for debate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of Musk taking any responsibility as CEO for these numbers, rumors
      of a boycott on Tesla Motors have spontaneously appeared in the public
      discourse. A boycott that
      <a
        href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-cries-elon-illegal-liberal-boycott-tesla-1235293465/"
        >Trump, Musk, and Conservatives</a
      >
      on the internet are convinced exists and is the sole source of Tesla’s
      woes. Not only does this boycott <em>definitely</em> exist, but it is also
      <a
        href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/11/president-trump-elon-musk-tesla-boycott-illegal-evs/"
        ><em>illegal</em></a
      >
      according to Trump.
    </p>

    <p>
      While signs of a political organization, non-profit, or even a discord
      channel coordinating or calling for this boycott are yet to be found,
      there are many news sources asserting that this boycott is entirely legal.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTpyIwAdJ7A">NBC</a>,
      <a
        href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-cries-elon-illegal-liberal-boycott-tesla-1235293465/"
        >Rolling Stone</a
      >, and
      <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/trump-tesla-boycott-musk"
        >the Guardian</a
      >
      all state with confidence that this boycott is totally legal and actually
      is protected by the first amendment. Lacking from these articles are any
      evidence of a boycott, explanation of what makes a boycott legal or not,
      and whether legality is even appropriate to discuss if this Tesla boycott
      does exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annoyed by the poor discussion around the topic, I will attempt to provide
      a short legal overview of boycotts, when they are protected, and whether
      Musk is the victim of an illegal global conspiracy to make him personally
      feel bad.
    </p>

    <h4>What is a boycott?</h4>

    <p>
      While “boycott” may be a term used in common parlance, it has a specific
      meaning in a legal context. A boycott, also referred to as “concerted
      refusal to deal”, is an agreement among a number of economic actors to
      sever or limit economic relations with another economic actor or actors.
      Put more plainly, coordinated action by people or businesses in a market
      to harm or change the behavior of a business or businesses.
    </p>

    <p>Boycotts are generally classified into three categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Commercial</em>, meaning its goal is for the profit of its members.
        A group of retailers refusing to purchase from a wholeseller who sells
        to a competitor of the members of the group would be a commercial
        boycott.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Economic</em>, meaning its goal is for the economic benefit of its
        members, but without a commercial purpose. A union striking for higher
        wages is for the economic benefit of the union members, but it doesn’t
        have a commercial purpose, so it would be an economic boycott.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Noneconomic</em>, meaning its goal has no connection to the self
        interest of its members. If city residents boycott a diner that displays
        a “we don’t hire blacks” sign behind the register, the citizens have no
        material self-interest in the boycott, so it would be a noneconomic
        boycott. (Though if only the black residents boycotted the diner, it may
        be found to be economic).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>When are boycotts illegal?</h4>

    <p>
      In 1890
      <a
        href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/sherman-anti-trust-act"
        >the Sherman Anti-Trust Act</a
      >
      was passed and formed the basis of all modern antitrust law in America.
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1"
        >Section 1 of the Act</a
      >
      makes any contract or conspiracy to restrict trade illegal, this has been
      interpreted to include boycotts as described above.
    </p>

    <p>
      The majority of courts agree all commercial and almost all economic
      boycotts are always illegal. Noneconomic boycotts are a difficult
      category, some courts arguing they should always be illegal, others saying
      they can’t be illegal. Recently, courts have preferred to apply the
      “rule-of-reason” test when examining a noneconomic boycott. This means
      that these boycotts are evaluated on a case by case basis, to see if the
      restraint on trade caused by the boycott will be “significantly
      anticompetitive in purpose or effect.” More directly, courts must weigh
      the government’s interest in preventing anti-competitive pressures on a
      market against the rights of the members of the boycott. It is important
      to note, while not irrelevant, harm to the target of a boycott is far less
      important than the anticompetitive effects on the market in this analysis.
    </p>

    <h4>When boycotts are speech.</h4>

    <p>
      The common law has always recognized peaceful boycotting by collective
      members of the public to have some level of constitutional protection,
      even if the boycott would otherwise be illegal. Most often implicated are
      the right to petition and the right to expressive conduct, both derived
      from First Amendment protections. When weighing these rights in the
      context of a boycott, the goals, execution, and target of a boycott are
      scrutinized. Boycotts aimed at improving public life, influencing
      government action, or punishing companies or industries perceived to be
      committing a moral wrong, are all more likely to be found legal. Courts
      have also shown sympathy if the boycott is the only, or the most
      effective, method of expression that the group could meaningfully employ.
      However, any violence, whether for enforcement of behavior by members or
      enacted on targets by members, immediately forfeits any protections.
      Additionally, targets and methods of such boycotts often are required to
      be directly related to the goal of the boycott itself.

    <h4>Getting back to the point.</h4>

    <p>
      Currently, it’s not clear if there are any participants in a boycott of
      Tesla. Boycotts require interdependent, not independent, actions between
      the actors. Interdependent actors are ones who can only explain their
      actions by their coordination with other members. Actors who act in
      parallel, but commit such actions only based on their own decision to do
      so, cannot make up a boycott. Musk has given any number of reasons for
      people in the
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions/index.html"
        >US</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://www.ibanet.org/Musk-exposes-cracks-in-UK-political-donations-legislation"
        >UK</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/musk-rallies-far-right-europe-tesla-is-paying-price-2025-03-04/"
        >Germany</a
      >, and most other nations, to independently not want to buy his vehicles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming a boycott could be found, and members be brought to court, Tesla
      would likely be unable to show that the boycott is commercial or economic
      in nature. There is no profit to be gained by the members of the group,
      nor is there an economic but non-commercial benefit. Meanwhile, there are
      any number of noncommercial justifications for the boycott, punishing
      Musk’s behavior, pushing for his ejection from the US government,
      <a
        href="https://carbuzz.com/tesla-surge-gamed-canada-ev-rebates-illegally/"
        >the company’s allegedly illegal sales reporting to abuse environmental
        grants.</a
      >
      These and more are almost certainly valid public interest targets, to
      evidence a noncommercial boycott.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming there is a boycott, and the Court finds it to be noncommercial,
      would it survive a “rule-of-reason” test? Well... this is where the
      optimism ends. Antitrust opinions often have the same feeling as those in
      constitutional law. Everything is vague and amorphous, until it is not.
      You have clear tests, until the tests actually mean something else. When
      it is time to balance interests, every judge has a different set of
      scales. Cases with almost identical facts, applied to the same tests, in
      neighboring jurisdictions resulted in opposite outcomes. This is most true
      when dealing with noncommercial boycotts.
    </p>

    <p>
      A
      <a
        href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep458/usrep458886/usrep458886.pdf"
        >SCOTUS decision from 1982</a
      >
      is often trotted out regarding public protest and boycotting. Those
      unfamiliar with the field like to claim that the SCOTUS has put this issue
      to bed, something something first amendment + boycott = legal. While not
      irrelevant, the decision is far from controlling, or that simple. The
      facts in this case are not easily compared to the Tesla boycott, and
      antitrust courts notoriously have made decisions that fly in the face of
      SCOTUS opinions. Remember, a noneconomic boycott’s best day in court
      places it in a “rule-of-reason” analysis that forces the court to evaluate
      it on a case by case basis. There is no guaranty how a judge might
      evaluate these very complex facts and laws. Despite what some may tell
      you, boycotting as a protected form of protest, especially in the current
      political and judicial climate, is not a foregone conclusion.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking forward.</h4>

    <p>
      If a court found the boycott to be legal, and assuming the SCOTUS doesn’t
      swoop in to grant Musk everything he wants, then Tesla’s legal recourse
      would largely be over. If a court instead found the boycott to be illegal,
      what’s the worst that could happen? The US judicial system would become
      the single greatest car salesmen by forcing the defendants to buy a Tesla?
      Jokes aside, one remedy for boycotts is an injunction against organizing
      and maintaining a boycott. In this case, an injunction against the members
      of the boycott’s speech encouraging or supporting the boycott of Tesla
      motors.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this injunction against speech in mind, Trump and conservative voices
      claiming an <em>illegal</em> boycott exists with no evidence begins to
      make sense. This, and other legal strategies, by this administration, are
      being rapid fire created and tested in the courts, in an attempt to
      infringe on the rights of Americans and American businesses. While a court
      might try to tailor such an injunction to be narrow, the Administration
      would almost certainly apply it without abandon. Any public statement
      critiquing Tesla, or Musk, or the Administration that Musk is a part of
      may be interpreted by this administration as support of this illegal
      boycott, and therefore must be silenced. Ending any boycott that may or
      may not exist is of little concern to Trump and his administration, the
      real prize may be a veneer of judicial approval to silence their
      detractors.
    </p>

    <h4>Wrapping all this up.</h4>

    <p>
      The boycott that Trump and conservatives are crying about almost certainly
      does not exist. However, that does not mean they cannot gaslight
      themselves, and the public, into creating one, and use this fiction to
      enact their authoritarian goals. An enemy you create is far more useful
      than one you actually have to fight, and the laws surrounding boycotts are
      so loose as to create an opportunity to further expand their authoritarian
      control.
