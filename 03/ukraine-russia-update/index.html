      To start the week off, President
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/zelensky-saudi-arabia-prince-ukraine-meeting.html"
        >Zelenskyy</a
      >
      traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
      on Monday, March 10, 2025. Zelenskyy departed after the talks, leaving a
      high-level Ukrainian delegation (including his chief of staff and defense
      minister) to meet U.S. officials the next day on Tuesday. With US Aid and
      Intelligence still being halted by the Trump administration, Russia
      intensified its offensive around the
      <a
        href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-10-2025"
        >Kursk region</a
      >
      – Ukraine’s forces, who had seized a foothold there last year, came under
      mounting pressure from a Russian counterattack.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Tuesday, March 11, 2025, we would finally get to see the Ukrainian
      delegation meeting with US representatives since the horrid meeting that
      took place in the Oval Office the previous week. This meeting again showed
      Ukraine’s desire for peace as they agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, pushing
      the ball of peace talks over into the Kremlin’s court. This move paid off:
      the United States, recognizing Ukraine’s resolve, restored paused

      >
      sharing almost immediately. Rubio is quoted as saying “If they say no,
      then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.”
      driving home again the onus is on the Kremlin. Of course it’s yet to be
      seen if the Trump admin is willing to hold Putin accountable to preventing
      peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      By Wednesday,
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/europe/russia-claim-recaptured-sudzha-intl"
        >Putin</a
      >
      finally resurfaced, staging a PR visit to the Kursk region right after
      Russian forces retook the largest town that Ukrainian troops had managed
      to capture there. The Kremlin was quick to spin this as a major victory,
      with Putin’s appearance clearly choreographed to boost morale and project
      strength—despite the very real setbacks Russia has faced elsewhere.
      Another
      <a
        href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-urkaine-war-kremlin-keith-kellogg-special-envoy-barred-talks-rcna195981"
        >article</a
      >
      that caught my attention was concerning Lt. Gen. Keith Kellog, the Trump
      administration’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, one who Trump
      bragged about being key in the “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH” plan. Kellog seems
      to have been sidelined at the behest of the Kremlin for being “too close
      to Ukraine” according to a senior Russian official. Again I find myself
      wondering exactly why we continue to allow our adversaries to dictate the
      terms of this war, but this is the Trump admin so we shouldn’t be shocked.

    <p>
      Thursday, the dream of a quick peace or at least ceasefire came to an end,
      with
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-close-ejecting-ukrainian-forces-kursk-kremlin-says-2025-03-13/#:~:text=MOSCOW%2C%20March%2013%20%28Reuters%29%20,were%20worked%20out%20or%20clarified"
        >Putin</a
      >
      formally rejecting the 30-day ceasefire proposal, insisting that fighting
      would continue until Russia’s “crucial conditions” were met​. He insisted
      that fighting would continue until Russia’s “crucial conditions” were met,
      which, predictably, mirrored the Kremlin’s usual demands—from forcing
      Ukraine to renounce its NATO ambitions to recognizing territory Russia has
      seized as its own. Of course our “strong” Trump admin was again silent,
      regardless of Rubio’s strong words on Tuesday, the Trump admin gave no
      public pushback. Rubio, even when speaking at a G7 summit, noted that the
      peace process was “some steps closer” despite the setback​.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Friday, we got a very, VERY small glimpse into
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-cautious-optimism-ukraine-ceasefire-after-trump-envoys-moscow-visit/"
        >Trump’s</a
      >
      envoy’s visit to Moscow the previous day. The only real details shared
      were that “additional information was provided to the Russian side” and
      that “Putin passed on information and additional signals to President
      Trump” through Witkoff. More signs that Russia and the U.S. seem to be
      coordinating behind closed doors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later that day, Trump took to Truth Social to amplify a Kremlin talking
      point, claiming “thousands of encircled Ukrainian troops” in the Kursk
      region were at risk of dying and that he personally asked for their lives
      to be spared. While it’s true that Russia has been making gains in Kursk,
      the Institute for the Study of War (<a
        href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-14-2025"
        >ISW</a
      >) reported that there is “no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian
      forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian troops in Kursk
      Oblast or anywhere along the frontline.”
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, on Saturday, while scrolling through social media, I came
      across reports of the first successful combat test of Ukraine’s long-range
      <a
        href="https://mil.in.ua/en/news/long-neptune-has-reached-range-of-1000-km/"
        >“Long Neptune”</a
      >
      missile. With an effective combat range of 1,000&nbsp;km (621&nbsp;mi), it
      appears by some reports to be what struck the oil refinery in
      <a href="https://x.com/nexta_tv/status/1900901706386317522">Tuapse</a>,
      Russia, though there’s no definitive confirmation—just a well-timed
      coincidence between the missile’s test and the refinery going up in
      flames. This new Long Neptune is from the same missile systems that sank
      the

      in April 2022, and now, with this upgrade, Ukraine has a weapon capable of
      striking Moscow itself!
