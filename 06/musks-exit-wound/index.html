      Trump made it official this week. It’s not a question of if, but when,
      Elon makes his exit. He was always bound to a short term in government. He
      has no patience to be bound or liable to a proper confirmation process,
      which means he is only allowed 130 days in the government. And while rules
      have never really been a concern for the Trump crew, the laws of nature,
      and the scrutiny of public opinion reign in even the most stubborn – and
      no one is finding Elon’s cosplaying as government tech support cute
      anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences are hitting Elon pretty hard too, and it’s getting
      uncomfortable even for the guy with the most “fuck you” money. His net
      worth grew to over $400 billion shortly after Trump’s election, but has
      since tumbled to about
      <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/">$330 billion today</a
      >. His net worth is likely to get hit more over the tariffs,
      <a
        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2025/04/04/elon-musk-stays-quiet-on-tariffs-as-tesla-nosedive-continues/"
        >something he had been curiously mum about</a
      >
      even though it will hurt basically all his companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tesla has been hit the hardest,
      <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-worth"
        >dropping about 46% from its peak in December</a
      >. Although stark, it’s actually trading at roughly the levels it was
      before Trump’s re-election, but public sentiment toward the car company is
      prime-time news with dealerships being a rallying point for protesters and
      the cars themselves being targets for vandalism. Elon’s hard right turn
      has turned off the largely progressive customer base that supported the
      car company, and the consequences are being felt. Elon has made several
      attempts to rectify the drop in sales, like getting Trump to make a big
      showing of

      Musk has also had several instances of his personal life spilling into
      public discourse. A few of his baby mamas have become quite vocal over his
      lack of support. Grimes has been his most public relationship, but her
      pleas to keep her

      >. Ashley St. Claire has resorted to Twitter spats trying to get her child
      support, something denied after she<a

        broke her silence about him fathering a child with her</a

      to reiterate Musk’s general absence from her life and how she finds out
      about new half-siblings through social media. Musk is getting a
      father-of-the-year award from no one.

      The fall of Elon has been pretty remarkable. The guy was used to inspire
      Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man character. At one time, he was seen as a
      liberal hero out to beat climate change and take humans to Mars. All it
      took to knock him off that track was his kid coming out as trans and a

        >White House snub</a
      >
      from a meeting of the minds on electric cars during Biden’s tenure. Yet
      another casualty of the “Left was mean to me, so now I’m a Republican”
      trope that led straight to his bankrolling Trump and Sig Heiling
      Republican audiences. The fallout from this one is particularly impactful.

      Musk’s temporary foray into government work has put him at the head of
      DOGE so he can literally and figuratively chainsaw through our government
      infrastructure. His targets have been telling. USAID was the first to be
      crumbled, kneecapping our decades-long efforts to build goodwill and soft
      power throughout the world. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has
      largely been halted even though it’s largely seen as a successful
      department and has

      >
      and is largely considered a frustrating obstacle to financial
      institutions. The Department of Education has taken aggressive steps to
      curb grants to any

      The effects of these policies will likely not be fully realized in the
      immediate future, and while some are cheering Musk’s exit, I’m not so sure
      it’s going to have the positive impact they believe. While all this is
      horrible and Musk is credited as being the orchestrator, he is also the
      thing everyone is watching. What if Musk’s exit also takes away the
      attention these changes have been getting? Many of these changes are being
      challenged in the courts right now, and these battles are long from over.
      I hate Musk’s trolling as government tech support and his dark MAGA hat,
      and so do a lot of other people. Without Musk’s limelight shining on this
      shit show, how many people are going to start to tune out?
    </p>
    <p>
      So sure, Elon might finally slink off stage, but don’t pop the champagne
      yet. He’s already gutted key agencies, fired a quarter million workers,
      and handed out sledgehammers to people who think governance is just
      leftist overreach. If he walks, the damage doesn’t. The difference?
      Without his chaos magnet pulling headlines, the rest of the wreckage gets
      to rot in peace. It might be the most dangerous part of his legacy: not
      what he broke while everyone was watching, but what keeps breaking when no
      one is. The villain exits stage right, and the audience, bored without
      their favorite clown, stops watching while the real horror unfolds behind
      the curtain.
