      A few weeks ago in the direct aftermath of the Zelenskyy Oval Office
      meeting, a concoction of emotions swirled distressingly within me. Anger
      against Trump and Vance, who both peddled Russian talking points and
      coordinated an ambush designed to degrade and humiliate Zelenskyy, hoping
      he would submit to a false peace. Anger against the reporter who asked an
      irrelevant question – this time a talking point from the MAGA-ist
      themselves and not the Russians but who knows these days – about
      Zelenskyy’s attire, while Trump subtly grinned. Anger against the MAGA-ist
      base for who this intricate and grotesque show was manufactured for,
      chiefly for their sadism. Sadness for Zelenskyy who with the hopes of his
      people on his shoulders had to sit there in disbelief while realizing the
      Russians were getting exactly what they wanted. Sadness for the post-WW2
      American goodwill and leadership that they were so carelessly shredding.
      At the time I wanted to write my emotions down as a memory of a painful
      day and as a summation of my rationale, which I felt wasn’t getting
      through to those disengaged. However, procrastination prevented me from
      fulfilling my desire and everything was left unsaid.

      It was through this abyss of despair that I can proclaim today – all the
      while missiles still impact in Ukraine, soldiers continue to fight and
      negotiations resume between autocrats – that I am optimistic. Yes, issues
      exist domestically and Ukraine needs America now more than ever, but a
      coalition has been revitalized in the fight for sovereignty and democracy.
      The Trump described “free-loaders” are stepping up. Our European, Asiatic
      and other allies have rallied in support of Ukraine. The series of events
      following the Oval Office meeting have been as follows. A summit was held
      with Zelenskyy and European leaders where European leaders agreed to
      increase defense spending and send additional aid to Ukraine. Plans were
      floated to have European troops on the ground in Ukraine following a
      cease-fire or peace deal to deter further Russian aggression. The German
      elections were held in which the pro-Putin parties of the AFD and BSW were
      denied a place in the governing coalition. The victor, Friedrich Merz, is
      pushing for and will succeed in reforming the debt-brake to begin the
      rearmament of Europe’s largest economy.

      The period between the 2024 election and the Oval Office meeting, felt
      like an inevitable lurch towards a MAGA-infused populist vision of leading
      Ukraine to whither on the vine. The events described previously, as well
      as others unmentioned, show a different path is possible. The fight may
      not over but our defeat isn’t inevitable.
