      On April 2, 2025, Donald Trump unveiled new, vast tariff hikes, the likes
      of which haven’t been seen in the US since the 1930s and the Smoot-Hawley
      Tariff act. “Liberation Day”
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcoAYkb6gYg&amp;t=36s"
        >as Trump called it</a
      >
      “will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the
      day America’s <a href="https://www.destiny.gg/">destiny</a> was reclaimed,
      and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.” The stock market
      immediately responded, with the DOW, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ all dropping
      roughly 10% by close on
      <a
        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/investing/stock-market-dow-tariffs/index.html"
        >Friday, April 4</a
      >. Let’s take a look at a historic move that economists are calling “<a
        href="https://bsky.app/profile/justinwolfers.bsky.social/post/3llvttymhfr2g"
        >indescribably crazy</a
      >”, “<a href="https://x.com/LHSummers/status/1907603075239383463"
        >masochistic</a
      >”, and “<a
        href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/will-careless-stupidity-kill-the"
        >sheer, malignant stupidity</a
      >”.
    </p>

    <h4>So what exactly did Trump do?</h4>

    <p>
      On Wednesday, Donald Trump signed
      <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06027.pdf"
        >Executive Order 14256</a
      >, which formally declares a national emergency and
      <a
        href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/407051/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-major-questions"
        >gives Trump an insane amount of authority</a
      >
      over tariffs. Using this authority, Trump imposed a
      <a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/"
        >baseline tariff of 10%</a
      >
      for all countries, and individualized tariffs for 60 countries. These
      include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>20% to the European Union</li>
      <li>34% to China (bringing their total to 54%)</li>
      <li>24% to Japan</li>
      <li>46% to Vietnam</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And a
      <a
        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/business/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-countries-list-dg/index.html"
        >whole lot more</a
      >. Notably, there are a few big names missing off of the list. Mexico and
      Canada managed to avoid this round of tariffs, but they are already
      subject to 25% on goods that aren’t compliant with the
      <a

        >United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a
      >. Russia was kept off because they already had pre-existing sanctions due
      to the war in Ukraine, according to the
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjl3k1we8vo.amp"
        >White House and Russian state media</a
      >. North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus have avoided tariffs as well, once again

    <h4>How did they get these numbers?</h4>

    <p>
      The official answer was posted by the
      <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations"
        >Office of the U.S. Trade Representative</a
      >. Simply put, it’s the country’s trade deficit divided by its exports to
      the United States times 1/2. Now you might be thinking “gosh, this seems
      really simple! I thought making tariffs truly reciprocal and match dollar
      for dollar would be really hard, considering the complexities of
      international trade and foreign economies.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/economy/reciprocal-tariff-math/index.html"
        >You’d be correct</a
      >. Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winning economist, points out that Trump’s
      calculations only considers trade in GOODS, and not

        href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/20y_e/services_brochure2015_e.pdf"
        >trade in SERVICES</a
      >, for example IT support. Considering the USA has been a service based
      economy since the
      <a
        href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/the-first-service-economy"

        >many egregious mistakes</a
      >
      with the way these tariffs were calculated. Even the majority of the
      economists referenced in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s
      blog post have spoken out, basically stating that their work is
      <a
        href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-white-house-cited-these-economists-to-justify-its-tariffs-they-arent-thrilled-193615537.html"
        >not being applied correctly</a
      >
      by the administration. The disconnect between economists’ opinions on the
      method and the similarities to methods produced by

        >chatGPT, if asked</a
      >, have led to speculation that the formula is made by the AI chatbot.
      Regardless of how the tariffs were created, the results have even top

      has been arguably the most consistent position he’s had. He’s been vocal
      about this for

      to do so, and even if it does the jobs may not be worth the pain. Trump’s

      I’ll leave it to u/Zeraphant to get into the speculative portions about
