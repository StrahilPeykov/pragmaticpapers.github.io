      On Sunday, March 30, 2025,
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/30/ukraine-war-briefing-kyiv-accuses-russia-of-war-after-attack-on-military-hospital-in-kharkiv#:~:text=,who%20is%20in%20serious%20condition">Russia</a>
      continued its unrelenting drone strikes on Ukraine, launching nearly 200
      drones against various cities in response to its own unsubstantiated
      claims that Ukraine had targeted Russian energy infrastructure the day
      before. Russia being Russia, then struck a hospital, a shopping center,
      and multiple apartment blocks in Kharkiv—an act President Zelenskyy
      denounced as a “deliberate” targeting of a hospital. In a surprising
      pivot, U.S. President Donald
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/donald-trump-angry-vladimir-putin-ukraine-nbc">Trump</a>
      declared himself “very angry” with Vladimir Putin’s repeated attacks on
      Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, going so far as to threaten heavy secondary
      tariffs on Russian oil if the Kremlin continues to stall on a ceasefire.
      Citing Putin’s suggestion that Ukraine be placed under temporary UN
      administration, Trump warned he could impose up to a 50% tariff on any
      country purchasing Russian oil—though he also hinted he would back down
      quickly if the Kremlin “does the right thing.”

      On Monday, March 31, 2025, the
      <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-compulsory-military-draft-of-160-000-men-the-largest-in-14-years/#:~:text=Russian%20President%20Vladimir%20Putin%20signed,owned%20media%20TASS%20reported">Kremlin</a>
      launched its largest draft in over a decade—160,000 men—further evidence
      that Russia has no real intention to negotiate. Coming on the heels of
      territorial gains in Kursk and a wavering U.S. stance, Putin’s move
      reinforced the perception that Moscow is deliberately stalling any deal or
      ceasefire to exploit what it sees as Western weakness. This sweeping
      conscription campaign, reported by state-owned media TASS, marks the
      biggest call-up since 2011 and signals how deeply entrenched Russia is in
      the conflict. Meanwhile,
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/ukraine-war-briefing-eu-ministers-call-out-kremlin-for-delaying-ceasefire#:~:text=,an%20EU%20foreign%20ministers%E2%80%99%20meeting">EU foreign ministers</a>
      convened in Madrid and accused Moscow of “playing games and not really
      wanting peace.” France and Poland pressed for a firm deadline to push
      Russia into actual negotiations—rather than letting the Kremlin keep
      “passing the ball” down the field. Coupled with President Trump’s threats
      of additional oil tariffs, it showed that while Washington might be on a
      different page, at least it was still reading the same chapter as Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday In what felt like an increasingly rare show of unity, half of the
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/ukraine-war-briefing-us-pressure-builds-on-russia-over-refusal-to-accept-ceasefire#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D">U.S. Senate</a>—25 Republicans and 25 Democrats—came together to propose a new round of
      “hard-hitting” sanctions on Russia if the Kremlin continued to avoid
      serious negotiations. The bipartisan legislation threatens tariffs on
      nations purchasing Russian oil, gas, and uranium, signaling that even with
      the Trump administration’s erratic stance, Congress could be ready to turn
      up the pressure. Zelenskyy, speaking alongside Germany’s foreign minister,
      backed the move and urged the U.S. to follow through, citing fresh Russian
      violations of the limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure.
    </p>

      It only took a day for the Kremlin to seemingly work its way back into
      Trump’s good graces. On Wednesday,
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/ukraine-war-briefing-deadly-ballistic-missile-strike-on-zelenskyy-home-town#:~:text=,suspend%20so%20he%20could%20visit">Putin’s envoy</a>
      Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, arrived in
      Washington for meetings with Trump officials—marking the first high-level
      Russian visit since the war began in 2022. Dmitriev, long tied to Trump’s
      inner circle, was granted a temporary sanctions waiver just to make the
      trip, shedding light on how actively the Trump administration is
      maintaining its Kremlin backchannel. And for the talks on potential
      tariffs on nations still importing Russian oil and gas, instead, Ukraine
      would be tacked with a 10% levy while Russia managed to avoid the tariffs
      entirely. While this occurred Russia continued its missile and drone
      strikes on Ukraine killing 4 and wounding 14, all civilians as the strikes
      targeted the residential area of Kryvyi Rih.
    </p>

      On Thursday, Ukraine began warning that Russia is preparing to increase
      its troop presence in occupied territories by as many as 150,000 soldiers
      over the course of 2025—roughly the size of 15 full divisions. According
      to Ukrainian officials, recruitment and formation of these new units is
      already underway. The move confirms what many have suspected: that Russia
      is stalling ceasefire talks to buy time and build up for another major
      offensive. While Russia publicly engages in limited maritime-focused
      negotiations, their growing presence on the front lines makes their
      intentions all too clear. Also on Thursday, it was reported that U.S.
      Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will skip next week’s Ramstein
      summit—marking the first time the Pentagon chief has been absent from the
      gathering since it began in 2022. The move further underscores the Trump
      administration’s desire to distance itself from allied military efforts,
      signaling a shift toward offloading the responsibility for Ukraine onto
      Europe at a time when U.S. foreign policy feels increasingly
      unpredictable—even to its own citizens and institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State
      <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/russia-ukraine-war/article/putin-ukraine-ceasefire-defence-chiefs-kyiv-77hxzmfrd?region=global">Marco Rubio</a>
      warned that Russia is running out of time to prove it’s serious about
      peace, stating that the Trump administration would know “in a matter of
      weeks” whether Putin is negotiating in good faith—or just buying time.
      Speaking from Brussels after two days of NATO meetings, Rubio revealed
      that new sanctions are already being drafted by Congress, and suggested
      the administration may not be able to stop them if progress stalls. While
      still pushing Europe to increase military spending to 5% of GDP, Rubio’s
      comments hinted at a quiet shift in the U.S. government. On the same day,
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wxe5g4z9yo">Russia</a>
      carried out one of the war’s deadliest attacks in recent months, once
      again striking Kryvyi Rih. The missile strike killed 19 civilians,
      including nine children, and wounded nearly 50 others. While the Kremlin
      claimed it was targeting a military meeting, the aftermath told a
      different story—residential buildings and a playground were hit.

    <p>
      The fallout from Friday’s missile strike in Kryvyi Rih—which killed 18
      civilians, including 9 children—continued to build as
      <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-appeals-pressure-russia-after-day-inhuman-strikes/story?id=120513428">President Zelenskyy</a>
      slammed the U.S. response as “weak” and accused Washington of being afraid
      to even name Russia as the perpetrator. He warned that diplomacy means
      nothing to Moscow, and that only real pressure—through sanctions and
      accountability—will have any impact on ending the war. Meanwhile, another
      diplomatic misstep surfaced stateside when the
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/trump-administration-apologizes-ukrainian-refugees">Trump administration</a>
      admitted it had mistakenly sent deportation notices to some Ukrainian
      refugees settled under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program. The
      Department of Homeland Security quickly walked back the threat of removal,
      but not before sparking widespread fear and confusion within Ukrainian
      communities across the U.S.
