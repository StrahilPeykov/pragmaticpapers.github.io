      On April 1, 2025, special elections were held in both Wisconsin and
      Florida, in what many people viewed as an early referendum on Trump’s
      administration. Though the results were mixed for Democrats, these
      elections provided hope in trying times and may be a preview of what’s in
      store for 2026.

    <h4>Wisconsin</h4>

    <p>
      In a historically expensive election,
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/01/nx-s1-5345862/wisconsin-supreme-court-crawford-schimel-election-results?">Wisconsin voters chose Judge Susan Crawford</a>
      to fill a seat on the state’s Supreme Court, preserving the court’s 4–3
      liberal majority. Crawford defeated former state Attorney General Brad
      Schimel by an estimated 10-point margin, despite Trump and Elon Musk very
      publicly backing Schimel, in a state
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_Wisconsin">Trump won very narrowly</a>
      less than 6 months ago.

      <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/03/24/crawford-campaign-leads-ad-spending-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-race/82570614007/">The 2025 race set a new national record</a>
      for judicial campaign spending, with expenditures nearing $100 million. A
      substantial share of that came from prominent donors, most notably
      billionaire Elon Musk, who contributed over
      <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/buying-time-2025-wisconsin">$21 million</a>
      to support Schimel. Musk also personally campaigned for Schimel, notably
      handing out million dollar checks to voters and saying the “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-says-future-civilization-stake-wisconsin-election-2052851">future of civilization</a>” was at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford’s victory is expected to have broad implications for Wisconsin’s
      legal landscape. The Supreme Court will likely hear cases in the coming
      term on
      <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/wisconsin-supreme-court-race-political-spotlight-abortion-rights-line">abortion rights, redistricting, and electoral policy,</a>
      all of which could significantly shape the state’s political future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/02/politics/voter-turnout-wisconsin-election-dg/index.html">Turnout was notably high</a>, which is understandable considering the current political climate.
      While Democrats overperform in special or off-cycle elections, higher
      turnout usually reduces how much Democrats perform by.
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/06/politics/florida-wisconsin-turnout-special-elections/index.html">This was not the case this time around</a>. Coupled with the results in Florida, this may be a significant
      indicator that Trump’s honeymoon period is over with.
    </p>

    <h4>Florida</h4>

    <p>
      In the 1st District, Jimmy Patronis successfully retained the seat for
      Republicans,
      <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-election-randy-fine-jimmy-patronis-7a11350a593a89551d6f7a88ccd22c0e">defeating Democrat Gay Valimont.</a>
      While Patronis was favored, the race proved to be closer than many had
      anticipated. With a margin of just over
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida%27s_1st_Congressional_District">15 percentage points</a>, this result is a large shift from the
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida%27s_1st_Congressional_District_election,_2024">32 point victory</a>
      Matt Gaetz enjoyed in November. The district, historically a stronghold
      for Republicans, saw more
      <a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/03/31/patronis-and-valimont-april-1-congressional-election/82738040007/">competitive turnout</a>
      this time around, lending credence to the idea that the Democratic base is
      energized and wanting to fight Trump’s sweeping changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar story occurred in the 6th district, as Republican
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida%27s_6th_Congressional_District_special_election,_2025">Randy Fine also claimed victory</a>, defeating Democrat Josh Weil. Fine, a state legislator, was able to
      secure the seat with a 14-point margin, but the race once again was much
      tighter than November’s, which saw
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida%27s_6th_Congressional_District_election,_2024">Michael Waltz win by over 30 points.</a>
      Fine’s victory was attributed to his strong alignment with local
      conservative values, particularly on issues like economic development and
      education. However, once again, Democrats have to feel good about this
      race.
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20kzrlnjgo">Josh Weil has never held public office</a>
      before, and once again cut the margin in victory in half from less than 6
      months ago.
