    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>
      14240 – Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating
      Procurement
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-25/pdf/2025-05197.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 20, 2025, published March 25, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 points out that the Government spends about $490 billion a year
      for common goods and services. It discusses the General Services
      Administration (“GSA”), established through
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/101">the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 USC 101</a>. It bemoans that the GSA has multiple agencies and subcomponents, and
      alleges that these entities are redundant and wasteful.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terminology used within the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 requires that the Administrator of the GSA be the executive
      agent for the acquisition of common goods and services as well as
      information technology for the entire Government.
    </p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO appears both simple and reasonable on its face. Centralizing
      purchasing for the government under one official in one place could lead
      to benefits of economies of scale. It also means that acquisitions can be
      more streamlined and kept under a single department. This is certainly
      what the Administration would like one to believe when reading the EO.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, consolidating this purchasing does little to streamline the
      process either with speed or in reducing redundancy. First, agencies and
      departments have largely created their own systems of procurement and
      purchasing, as they generally have discretion on spending the funds
      allocated to them by Congress. This is intentional to allow agencies to
      focus on relevant players within the market, as those agencies see best.
      It also has meant they can spread their funds as they see fit throughout
      the various states. Now as purchasing is ultimately controlled by fewer
      officials, they are more likely to relegate funds to fewer, and larger,
      vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While efficiency is the primary focus of the text of the bill, it is only
      a distraction from the political implications resulting from it. By
      consolidating procurement, it is unclear how this functions as more than
      veto power from the White House. The President will now have a single
      person or agency he can pressure to open or close the valve of funding for
      various agencies. The streamlining is not in procurement, but in the
      President’s ability to control it.
    </p>

      </div>

    <p>
      Finally, there is a serious consideration of cost both in time and money.
      The GSA will likely not have the context that the agencies themselves will
      have, meaning it will either become a rubber stamp or require unnecessary
      documentation to explain a request for procurement. Not only this, but it
      will now create delays in purchases and deliveries to almost every agency.
      While the Administration beats the drum about reducing waste, fraud, and
      abuse, this EO serves as a shining example that waste, fraud, and abuse is
      all they can accomplish.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      This EO, will be sold to the MAGA base as a win, and plays directly into
      the classic GOP propaganda machine. As the EO points out $490 billion is
      spent every year by the government. Trying to have a single office control
      that much spending, for an entity the size of the Government, will
      naturally lead to delays in purchasing. These delays in purchasing will
      lead to a delay in services and entitlements provided. Delays in services
      and entitlements, means spending less money and the Government able to use
      the money elsewhere. While the logic is dubious, the Administration will
      likely never hear reason otherwise. A similar logic can be seen playing
      out with the GOP’s stance towards the IRS. Despite investments in making
      the IRS more efficient have
      <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57444">one of the highest returns of any Federal spending</a>, republicans, and MAGA, aggressively try to cut IRS funding and IRS
      agent numbers. Applying this to all federal spending, will lead to less
      efficient regulation that negatively affects Donald Trump’s biggest
      donors, , and furnishing of benefits that could otherwise be funneled to
      clients of the Administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veto power on any government spending this EO provides the President
      means that, similar to the Administration’s illegal use of tariffs, the
      President can extract bribes and other concessions from those who suffer
      under his policies. If an EO is resisted by a governor, or the President
      believes a business owner should pay him money, or if he thinks a
      demographic didn’t vote for him enough, he now can simply withhold
      government spending to punish them, via the GSA. Now the President must at
      all times be appeased, which ultimately leads to a reduction in criticism
      and resistance, and an increase in his personal wealth and power.

    <h3>14241 – Immediate Measures To Increase American Mineral Production</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-25/pdf/2025-05212.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 20, 2025, published March 25, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 states that the United States possesses vast mineral resources,
      and that the Administration wishes for it to become self reliant with
      regards to mineral production and refinement. It cites energy, national
      security, and infrastructure amongst its various motivations to increase
      American mineral production.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders departments to identify all mineral production related
      plans within the agency for priority approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 requires the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council
      (“NEDC”), established via
      <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/20/2025-02928/establishing-the-national-energy-dominance-council">EO 14213</a>, to submit recommendations for the congress to clarify the treatment of
      waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the
      <a href="https://earthworks.org/assets/uploads/2018/05/1872-Mining-Law-text.pdf">Mining Act of 1872</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 requires the identifying of Federal land to be exploited for
      mineral production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders a number of agencies to take actions to directly
      stimulate the mineral production industry in America.
    </p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is something of a combination of
      <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-06/pdf/2025-03693.pdf">EO 14223</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-06/pdf/2025-03695.pdf">EO 14225</a>
      except it is about minerals and not timber/lumber.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      As with similar EOs that have been passed regarding natural resource
      imports and deposits owned by the federal government, it will harm the US
      economy for a slight increase in wealth for specific MAGA donors.

    <h3>
      14242 – Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and
      Communities
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-25/pdf/2025-05213.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 20, 2025, published March 25, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 bemoans the money spent by the Government on education and
      blames it all on the Department of Education (“DoE”). It further states
      that educational administrative bloat and the student loan crisis is the
      fault of the DoE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 directs the Secretary of Education to take all steps to
      facilitate the closure of the DoE and return any authority it possesses to
      the states.
    </p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that this does not dissolve the DoE, until Congress
      passes a bill that does so, the DoE will continue to exist, at least on
      paper. It does however direct the Secretary of DoE to take all measures
      short of doing so. This will lead to the firing of all DoE employees and
      the ending of all DoE programs that are not required by law or estoppel to
      be maintained.

      Demonstrators gather outside the offices of the U.S. Department of
      Education in Washington, D.C., on March 13 to protest against mass layoffs
      and budget cuts at the agency. - Bryan Dozier
    </p>
    <p>
      While there is direction for the DoE to “return any authority it possesses
      to the states”, this is little more than a virtue signal to the MAGA base.
      The DoE has little authority in the educational world, and there is almost
      nothing returned to the states.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      It is hard to understate how significantly this will harm the education
      system in the US. The grants and funds disbursed from the DoE makes up
      <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/18/what-the-data-says-about-the-us-department-of-education/">on average 12%</a>
      of each state's funding for education. Not only this but it also provides
      funding for disabled and special needs children Individual Education Plans
      that allows them to receive the educational support they need. It also
      manages and facilitates over $1.6 trillion in student loans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Administration has tried to argue that these funds and services will
      be managed by the Department of the Treasury and other agencies in the
      executive. Though there is nothing protecting these funds from being
      impounded, or funneled to corrupt means, or the student loans being sold
      off to private debt management firms. Without the DoE rural and low income
      areas will suffer significantly. Meanwhile charter schools, school
      vouchers programs, and religious schools are likely to flourish under the
      Administration’s policy.

    <h3>
      14243 – Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-25/pdf/2025-05214.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 20, 2025, published March 25, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 says that it is necessary to eliminate siloed information based
      on government agency as it creates redundancy and hinders detection of
      fraud.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 requires that all agencies allow agency heads and officials
      designated by the President to have unhindered access to all unclassified
      agency records, data, software systems, and IT systems.
    </p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      It cannot be understated how short sighted this EO is. At a glance, there
      may be some merit to the thought that information should be easily
      accessible amongst the upper ranks of the Government. However, with only a
      moment’s consideration, it should be easy to see why making access to such
      a massive amount of data, even unclassified, so ubiquitous opens the door
      for bad actors. The relaxation of interagency security has little benefit
      to the agency heads who will now have greater access. The only increase
      will be in weak points to this nation’s data.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      The Administration has taken multiple steps to make American data and
      cyber security more vulnerable in the last few months. The Government
      faces multiple cyber attacks every day on various agencies, individuals,
      and military targets. As many cyber security experts will tell you, human
      error or incompetence are often the most common and most efficient ways to
      gain access to a secure system. Now a single agency head is a weakness for
      the entire government system. It is very likely that we will see a
      significant security breach in the next few years due to the bumbling
      actions of some smooth brained rube that is appointed to the head of some
      agency.

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 provides a summary of how Paul Weiss debased itself in response

    </p>
    <p>Section 2 revokes EO 14237.</p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      Paul Weiss discarded any integrity and ethical practice of their business
      to instead kiss Donald Trump’s ring. For this, Donald Trump has revoked
      the EO targeting them.

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

      The President’s continued attack on the legal profession is becoming the

    <h3>14245 – Imposing Tariffs on Countries Importing Venezuelan Oil</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-27/pdf/2025-05440.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 24, 2025, published March 27, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 discusses Venezuela and Tren de Aragua harming America and the
      need to further punish them and the Maduro regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 imposes a 25 percent tariff on all oil imports from Venezuela,
      including those indirectly imported from other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Commerce, State, and DOJ to determine if
      other countries are helping Venezuela to skirt this tariff and impose
      sanctions on these countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 requires a periodic report of the efficacy of these tariffs
      every 180 days.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5 contains definitions of terms within the EO.</p>
    <p>Section 6 states the EO will become effective April 2, 2025.</p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is mostly what it appears to be, a tariff on Venezuelan oil. It is
      more intense than other tariffs we’ve seen by this Administration, as it
      creates a policy of secondary tariffs against nations that “help”
      Venezuela avoid this tariff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to take note of is that this EO attempts to legitimize the
      “threat” from Tren de Aragua to help legitimize both the Administration’s
      exercise of executive war powers and their hostility to Venezuela.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While I am no expert on oil markets, this is surprisingly counter to the
      Administration’s platform of lowering oil and energy prices. Venezuela
      holds one of, if not the, largest oil reserves in the world. While America
      and Venezuela have been antagonistic in the past, there is not a clear
      sparking point for this tariff.

      It is possible that the Administration is interested in scaling up the
      antagonism with Venezuela to maintain and escalate their justification of
      using wartime powers, despite there being no war. It is likely that there
      will be other statements and actions by the administration to keep
      Venezuela as a villain in the public eye.

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      The President’s continued attack on the legal profession is becoming the
      norm. We must praise those who fight like Perkins Coie and condemn those
      who kiss the ring like Paul Weiss.

    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is yet another, on its face, “common sense” EOs that fails under the
      barest scrutiny. The most common recipients of government payments are the
      elderly, disabled, and impoverished. All people who are more likely to be
      unfamiliar or unable to transition from using checks to electronic
      payments. While such a transition away from checks is possible, it places
      an unnecessary burden, on an unnecessarily brief time table, for some of
      the most vulnerable members of society. Any cost of making payments via
      check is easily outweighed by the possible harm that could result from
      this decision. Additionally, any cost of redundancy or fraud is equally as
      present with digital payments.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      In the short term, this will almost certainly reduce the amount of money
      paid out by the SSA. The elderly disproportionately use checks compared to
      any other demographic. This, on top of closing regional offices, call
      centers, and removing the ability to file via mail, means that retirees
      will only suffer further as receiving their funds becomes more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we look further out, there will be a significant cost to the Government
      in changing their systems from checks to electronic payments. Not only
      will payment systems, software, and all the support to go with them need
      to be established, but the vendors, employees, and processes established
      around check payments will need to be decommissioned. While there are
      arguments that electronic payments are less vulnerable to fraud than
      checks being sent via mail, this is suspect when keeping in mind the
      recent executive actions taken to weaken the government’s cyber security
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may also be some private moves happening we aren’t seeing, the
      government will have an expanded need for electronic payment processing.
      This means that Donald Trump now gets to play king maker and hand a
      massive contract to the highest bidder, no doubt a contract that will also
      personally enrich him.

    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 runs up and down to try to convince the reader that voting used
      to be a good thing, but has been tainted by fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 orders that for mail in voter registration, a person requires a
      proof of citizenship. It also orders DHS to investigate foreign nationals
      voting by mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the SSA to use federal databases to confirm that there
      are no dead people on their voter roles and that voters are citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders that the Election Assistance Commission to withhold
      federal funds from states that do not follow federal election laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders the AG to investigate and pursue charges against those
      who have violated state and federal election laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 the AG and DHS are ordered to take all appropriate actions to
      prevent non-citizens from being involved in administration of any federal
      election. It also requires a review of all electronic registration and
      voting systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 tries to prevent absentee or mail in ballots from being
      delivered after election day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8 orders the AG and Secretary of the Treasury to prioritize the
      enforcement of laws to prevent foreign nationals from contributing to US
      elections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9 orders agencies to stop complying with EO 14019 despite it being
      revoked on January 20, 2025 in EO 14148.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10 creates severability for the sections of this EO, meaning that
      should one section be found illegal, the other sections will not be
      affected.
    </p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is with no sense of shame a blatant power grab by not only the
      executive but the federal government. The election clause CONSTITUTION
      vests the regulation an administration of federal elections in the state
      legislatures. While the Federal government can assist at the request of
      the states, and my pass laws via the Congress to regulate elections based
      on the constitutional rights of citizens, it has no power to take such
      direct action to monitor and control federal elections. Almost every part
      of this EO is a restraint or an attempt at restraint for populations
      likely to be in opposition to MAGA. The EO is also an attempt to solve
      problems that have never existed. Voter fraud due to mail in ballots, lack
      of voter ID, or non-citizens voting has never been recorded in significant
      numbers, certainly none that have been outcome determinative. However, the
      repeated pushing of voter fraud lies from the MAGA camp has now manifested
      in the actual government policy of the federal government attempting to
      intervene with state elections.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      As with almost every one of these EO’s this will quickly find itself in
      the courtroom. This is an over reach that cannot be ignored. We will
      likely see federal agents attempting to access voter data, influence
      election officials, and dictate illegal policy to state employees. Every
      instance of this needs to be pointed out and resisted. Such resistance
      will likely be used to “prove” the existence of voter fraud and only make
      the Administration attempt more draconian measures. This attack on
      Americans’ constitutional right to vote cannot be ignored or accepted.

    <p>
      It is likely this will become a major wedge between red and blue states.
      Blue states will rightfully reject these measures, while red states will
      happily lick the boot. Red states will attempt to legitimize this EO and
      associated federal actions, and use it to suppress liberal and minority
      voters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constitutionality of this EO and any associated actions is almost
      nonexistent, and in any normal administration would be struck down
      immediately. As this administration has shown that it is uninterested in
      following court orders, and Congress is not interested in checking
      executive power, it falls to the states and citizens to push back.

      14249 – Protecting America's Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05524.pdf">full text</a>, signed March 25, 2025, published March 28, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 discusses the Administration’s anxiety over fraud regarding the
      funds held and spent by the Government. It states that its goal is to
      create transparency and better track the transactions made by the
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 says that the government’s policy is to reduce fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <br>Section 3 states that agencies should follow anti-fraud laws and
      allow disclosure of records regarding transactions to the Treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 requires that agency heads have a certifying official for
      transactions made within agencies. It also requires a number of records
      for each transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 requires that agencies consolidate agency core financial
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 requires the secretary of the treasury and other agencies to
      consolidate their disbursements into a central disbursing agent at the
      treasury.
    </p>
    <p>Section 7 requires a compliance plan within 90 days.</p>
    <h4>What it Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is one of many that centralize the control of funds and create
      roadblocks to federal spending.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While it clearly is a measure to help make corruption within the
      whitehouse more efficient and profitable for the President, it is also
      just an increase in the administrative bloat. Agencies already have
      records of transactions, and procedures to follow the anti-theft laws. Now
      agencies must provide additional records, through an additional approval
      process. This not only will increase delays of payment, but cost of
      running the government.
