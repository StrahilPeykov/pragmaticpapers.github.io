      It seems obvious that groups go to war when they believe there are some
      spoils that are more valuable than the costs they expect to incur.
      However, there is one other component that is <em>necessary </em>for a war
      to occur: A bargaining friction. Two rational actors with perfect
      information will mutually prefer to settle on an outcome preferable to the
      expected outcome of war, minus costs:

    <p>
      A bargaining friction occurs when there is disagreement between the
      expected outcome of conflicts between the two parties, or the costs of
      war. Historically, our Neoliberal “More trade good” trading policy
      produced very few trade wars: We view the costs of such conflict as high,
      as any reduction in trade is understood to harm all parties. And we
      imagined the benefits would be low – that trying to extract or extort a
      few pennies on the dollars would, in the long run, be worth less than
      having prosperous neighbors and allies who were highly productive and able
      to contribute to a flourishing world economy. We have historically not
      been too concerned with trade deficits: When we give someone 100 green
      paper dollars for $100 worth of steel, we have both gotten richer. For us
      to make that transaction, both parties would need to agree that it was
      mutually beneficial.
    </p>

    <p>
      What changed with Donald Trump? Donald has been repeating constantly that
      we have been getting screwed, pillaged, looted. That our allies have been
      unfair to us. He has stated constantly that he sees a trade deficit of 200
      billion dollars as evidence that Canada is “getting over on us” for $200b.
      If we take him at his word, the problem reveals itself: Donald Trump may
      sincerely believe that when we hand someone 100 green paper dollars for
      $100 worth of steel, that they are “stealing” 100 dollars from us. If so,
      this creates a 1.2 trillion dollar bargaining friction between us and the
      nations we hold trade deficits with – a 1.2 trillion dollar mismatch
      between expectation and reality. An otherwise rational Trump, holding this
      belief, would be foolish not to go to war with… the entire rest of the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way Donald’s tariffs were calculated was by taking the “profits” the
      other nations make from our arrangement – their trade deficits – and
      tariffing them for half that amount. In his mind, he is being generous:
      Splitting the value they are extracting from our joint venture 50/50. He
      is not just being reasonable, in his mind he is being downright generous –
      America is the one “holding the cards” after all.
    </p>

    <h4>How does this play out?</h4>

    <p>
      There are alternative hypotheses for why he is choosing the current path.
      If we see him ease tariffs on specific industries, it would bolster the
      theory his primary goal is to create leverage against American companies.
      And a negotiation tactic does not explain why significant tariffs were
      placed on small nations like Vanuatu, Madagascar, or the Falkland islands.
      But the idea that he is trying to “meet countries in the middle” seems,
      currently, as the best explainer of all of the decisions made thus far.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this is the case, it is a dire prediction. Negotiations should be
      expected to peter themselves out, and be responsive to reality as the
      markets continue to plunge. But if it is the case that Trump is under the
      influence of a trillion-dollar bargaining friction, we should expect him
      to stay the course, or open up new fronts in the war if he is forced to
      step back from this one. The only long-term solution to the crisis would
      require the leader of the United States to rectify their beliefs with
      reality – and Trump is not someone to admit he made a mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a more reliable way to correct this disconnect: Impeachment. It
      seems like a pipe dream today, but the market was down 5% when I started
      this draft, and is down 10% as I wrap up. What happens if it drops another
      10% over the next month or two? What happens if he continues his trend of
      weekly scandals for 6 more months? There is a limit to how much damage he
      can do to society before republicans and independents begin, slowly, to
      turn on him. Slowly, slowly, and then all at once – when his allies begin
      to realize the ship is sinking and abandon him.

      The scenario I describe seems unlikely – Republicans have only gotten more
      loyal to him over the past 10 years, not less, and seem less responsive
      than ever to their constituents. But if there is even a small chance he
      can be impeached, it is our duty to fight for those odds – and we are not
      alone. The groundwork is being laid out by nation wide volunteers with
      “Operation anti king”. The first and earliest step will be to figure out
      where we stand by reaching out to every rep in the country over the next
      week and determining where everyone stands. This will take 20 minutes, and
      volunteers are needed for 30% of Congressional districts.
