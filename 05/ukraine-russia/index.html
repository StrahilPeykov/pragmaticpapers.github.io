      Negotiations between
      <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/23/three-killed-in-russian-attacks-on-kyiv-before-peace-talks-in-saudi-arabia">Ukraine and the United States</a>
      happened on Sunday, while we wouldn't learn until later what was spoken of
      and or agreed upon, Ukraine’s Defence Minister Umerov had at the least
      described them as “productive”. The talks themselves seemed to cover some
      of the same key issues being the protection of energy sites as well as
      other critical infrastructure. US special envoy Steve Witkoff spent his
      Sunday continuing to play defense for Putin, again stating that he
      believes Putin “wants peace”. With regards to Europe Witkoff said he
      doesn’t “see that he wants to take all of Europe”.

      On Monday, American and Russian teams began their closed-door
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/g-s1-55443/us-russia-ukraine-black-sea-ceasefire-talks-saudi-arabia">meetings</a>, which seemed to focus on a ceasefire in the Black Sea as a whole. The
      Kremlin seemed to still be passing the ball around between parties instead
      of making any concrete promises, even floating the potential renewal of
      the “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/black-sea-grain-initiative">Black Sea Grain Initiative</a>” that they abandoned in 2023. This initiative was agreed upon previously
      in order to guarantee the safe passport of Ukrainian Grain from the Black
      Sea ports to help protect global food security. With
      <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/five-facts-on-grain-and-the-war-in-ukraine/a-62601467#:~:text=Ukraine%20is%20one%20of%20the%20world's%20major%20grain%20producers.,13%25%20of%20the%20barley%20market">Ukraine accounting</a>
      for 10% of the world wheat market, 15% of the corn market, and 13% of the
      barley market, this aspect is crucial but often overlooked. Russia
      declined to renew the deal in July of 2023 due to it’s
      <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/moscow-russia-ukraine-war-threatens-to-walk-away-from-grain-deal-if-export-requests-arent-met/">demands of lessened sanctions</a>
      falling on deaf ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Tuesday, we learned that the brief meetings from earlier in the week
      had at least resulted in a limited
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-deal-black-sea.html">ceasefire</a>. The agreement specifically applied to fighting in the Black Sea and
      strikes on energy infrastructure.
      <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/03/outcomes-of-the-united-states-and-russia-expert-groups-on-the-black-sea/">The White House</a>
      released an official statement outlining the deal—though what stood out
      most was how heavily it focused on what the United States would be doing
      for Russia. Among the listed commitments: the U.S. would “help restore
      Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer
      exports,” and that the United States and Russia would “continue working
      toward achieving a durable and lasting peace.” President Zelenskyy quickly
      raised concerns, noting that easing sanctions on Russia would require
      European Union approval, and pointing out that the statement gave no clear
      start date for the ceasefire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took less than a day for Zelenskyy’s and Europe’s concerns over the
      <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/world/russia-ukraine-peace-deal-trump-intl-hnk/index.html">ceasefire deal</a>
      to start materializing. In a move that reportedly even surprised President
      Trump, Russia publicly declared it would only implement the agreement once
      sanctions were lifted—something that had never been formally agreed to.
      Once again, we saw Zelenskyy signing on to a ceasefire in good faith,
      while the Kremlin appeared to privately agree, only to walk it back in
      public. As for Trump’s response? The strongest pushback he offered was,
      “Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their
      feet. I’ve done it over the years.”.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday, the
      <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/27/coalition-of-the-willing-meets-in-paris-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine">Coalition of the Willing</a>
      met again—a group briefly covered in an earlier weekly report—consisting
      of representatives from 30 countries, including some officials from NATO
      and the EU. In my opinion, this led to the biggest news of the week:
      President Macron announced a plan to send “reassurance” forces from
      several European countries into strategic locations across Ukraine. Some
      reports suggest this could involve up to 30,000 troops, but there are a
      few important caveats: this reassurance force would only be deployed in
      the event of a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia—meaning the war
      would have to end—and they would not be positioned near front-line areas.
      For now, these forces are deliberately not being referred to as
      “peacekeepers,” but rather as a “deterrent” against Russian aggression—a
      way to make the Kremlin think twice before striking a town or base and
      risking the lives of French or British troops. Currently, only two
      nations—France and the UK—have pledged troops to this force, with Macron
      also announcing the deployment of a “Franco-British team to Ukraine” to
      “prepare the format of tomorrow's Ukrainian army” and help assess what
      equipment Kyiv will need in case of future Russian attacks.

      On Friday, the
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal-us.html">mineral deal</a>
      returned to the spotlight—this time raising a new concern that hadn’t been
      fully addressed before: how its economic terms could directly interfere
      with Ukraine’s path to joining the European Union. The latest draft,
      pushed by the Trump administration, revives earlier demands that Ukraine
      repay past U.S. aid (plus interest) and grants Washington significant
      control over a U.S.-managed investment fund overseeing future mineral
      projects. It also bans Ukraine from offering better terms to other
      countries and gives the U.S. veto power over third-party deals. President
      Zelenskyy said the proposal needed a “detailed study,” but lawmakers in
      Kyiv were already calling the terms impossible to accept. Then, as if
      tensions weren’t already running high,
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlxl37wnnyo">Vladimir Putin</a>
      suggested that Ukraine be placed under a temporary UN-led administration
      to oversee new elections and install what he called a more “competent”
      government. The idea was met with immediate backlash from Ukraine and its
      allies, who dismissed it as a blatant attempt to undermine Zelenskyy’s
      legitimacy and stall peace negotiations. The White House issued a rare,
      direct rebuttal—stating Ukraine’s governance would be decided by its own
      constitution and people.
    </p>

      As for the week, it felt like constant conversations of peace with little
      to no action. Europe is preparing for future security guarantees, but the
      United States seems unaware of the fact that an actual war is still being
      waged. On Saturday,
      <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-expects-russia-to-launch-fresh-offensive-to-strengthen-its-negotiating-position">Ukrainian officials</a>
      made it clear that Russia isn’t interested in peace just yet, warning that
      a new offensive is already in the works. According to intelligence
      reports, fresh strikes are expected soon—especially in Sumy, Kharkiv, and
      Zaporizhzhia—with some analysts saying the push could stretch across most
      of the year. And while diplomacy stalls,
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-belgorod.html">Ukraine</a>
      continues making bold moves of its own—resurfacing this week was Kyiv’s
      cross-border incursion into Russia’s Belgorod region, first launched
      earlier this month but now confirmed by military analysts and open-source
      footage. Ukrainian forces reportedly captured several villages, including
      Demidovka, likely hoping to offset Russian advances and gain leverage at
      the table.
