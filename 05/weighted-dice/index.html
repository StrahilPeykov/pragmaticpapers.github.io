      What is the probability that a random DGGer reading this completes their
      weekly political call-to-action?
    </p>
    <p>
      If I wrote an article advocating that each of us create a 30-second
      short-form video, it might be a 1% chance. If I tossed in some fiery
      language and reminded everyone that our country is burning but our hearts
      are ablaze, that we can only fight fire with fire, we might climb up to
      3%. If I counter concerns about efficacy with rational+based+epic logic,
      we might breach 5%. If I included an inspiring picture of my grade school
      chess club trophies and chiseled jawline, we would just round to 100%, no
      die would need to be cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how would we calculate the likelihood that each of our readers
      completes the call to action if $@#!&amp; mommy knocked over my dresser
      while cleaning on June 18th, 2013, destroying my trophies?
    </p>
    <p>
      When we calculate a probability (anytime anyone does) we are making
      guesses based on some assumptions. For a given reader, I can only guess
      their probability of activation based on assumptions about the average
      level of alignment, determination, and skepticism of our readers as a
      whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you, however, there is one person whose odds you don’t need to guess
      at.

      What is the likelihood that you, personally, will do some action this
      week? No guessing needed: 0% if you resolve not to, or, say, 80% if you
      resolve to. Either way, you'll have house odds against anyone betting
      against you, because you know that critical piece of unknown information
      required. How likely are you to find yourself in the top 20% of pearl
      divers? I’m assuming this is a safe zero. But how likely are you to find
      yourself in the top 20% of effective political actors in your city? Secret
      hint: Around half the people consuming over an hour of political content a
      day aren’t even voting in the midterms. Maybe a tenth of them have ever
      contributed outside of voting. Whatever your own level of conviction, it
      might not take as much as you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conviction alone won’t win you the presidency, but it is more than enough
      to take the next step, to punch outside your weight class, to be part of
      something, to have an impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are playing this game with weighted dice. All you have left to do is
      cast them.
