    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>
      14236 – Additional Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Action
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-20/pdf/2025-04866.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 14, 2025, published March 20, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 references EO 14148 that rescinded 78 EOs and memoranda from the
      Biden Administration and directed to the various Assistants to the
      President to find more EOs, memoranda and other proclamations that should
      be rescinded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 revokes
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TcpiPzye-zfB_Fdk7ebcDQ990rEsgiWOjHhI_OsYFvI/edit?tab=t.0"
        >this list</a
      >
      of executive actions.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      Broadly this EO focuses on further removing any progress or lasting policy
      from the Biden administration. Without going into the details of each
      repealed executive action, they can be broken into a number of categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, “Progressive” policy decisions. Promoting LGBT+ rights, workers
      rights and wages, reforming Tribal Nations’ funding, etc. These are
      generally offensive to the Administration for simply being associated with
      “liberal”, “leftist”, or “progressive” values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, economic actions, all of the actions associated with
      <a
        href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Defense_Production_Act_2018.pdf"
        >Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/11/2024-05220/scaling-and-expanding-the-use-of-registered-apprenticeships-in-industries-and-the-federal-government"
        >EO 14119</a
      >
      are all focused on stimulating the American economy, protecting a
      commodity or industry vital to national safety, or to protect the American
      consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, the remaining revoked actions are a hodgepodge of Covid,
      healthcare, weapons transfer, and energy shortage policy. While the
      political or economic motivation are not apparent on their face, the
      revocation of these EOs is merely because of its association with the last
      administration.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      While I cannot fully endorse every executive action being revoked, I can
      say that this kind of rapid and broad revocation creates a presumption of
      negligence on behalf of the Administration. Certainly when you also pair
      it with the fact that there is nothing replacing the executive actions
      being revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This EO is an almost direct harm to our nation by removing the executive’s
      ability to stabilize the markets of and promote domestic production for
      Insulin, baby formula, and a host of products within supply chains for the
      defense industry, to just name a few examples. The products listed in
      these executive action were subject to severe shortages, price hikes, and
      delays due to this market instability. By the executive taking a more
      direct, but narrow, action, they have been able to better stabilize and
      expand domestic production for these products. That of course was at the
      expense of those who were capitalizing on the instability of these
      markets. Now the Administration makes these products vulnerable to
      instability, and, despite their platform of American manufacturing,
      actually make it harder to produce these products in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worker training, federal minimum wage for government contractors, and
      promotion of international work place standards have all been set back
      thanks to this EO. The only benefit that comes from the revocation of
      these executive actions is to business owners, and overseas manufacturers.
      The Administration is making it clear, any wealth to be created in America
      is at the expense of workers, and to be retained by companies and their
      shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally it is no surprise that LGBT and Tribal Nations are a target of
      this Administration. Both are considered at the heart of progressive
      politics, and their suffering is the only needed motivation to harm them.
      Not only this, but MAGA and the GOP view both groups with clear derision
      and view any government spending designated for these groups as a waste of
      money. Though there was no question before, this is merely an affirmation
      that minorities and vulnerable communities are targets for this
      Administration.

    <h3>14237 – Assessing Risks From Paul Weiss</h3>

      >, signed March 14, 2025, published March 20, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      This is a very similar to
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-11/pdf/2025-03989.pdf"
        >EO 14230</a

      covered in last week’s

        >newsletter</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This is
      <a
        href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-targeted-20-biggest-law-092501746.html"
        >yet another</a
      >
      attack on the legal profession. This is Trump attempting to punish those
      who harmed him in the past and helped those who harmed him. It is a gross
      misuse of presidential power and likely an illegal targeting of a private
      business by the government.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      Unlike Perkins Coie’s
      <a
        href="https://www.perkinscoiefacts.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwnPS-BhBxEiwAZjMF0lVdPam9yVnnemEff9Q3phtEJQ82VE_DJwn6Gfbov9yhvP3JZ4zNlBoC1WYQAvD_BwE"
        >admirable defiance</a
      >
      of this gross action, Paul Weiss has instead bent
      <a
        href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/big-law-trump-executive-order/682173/"
        >both knees</a
      >
      and given the Administration $40 million in free pro-bono
      representation.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> While base and
      pathetic, it is also itself a potential ethical violation as it is
      essentially a quid pro quo for this firm to avoid legal action by the
      government, and to ensure they can receive contracts going forward. Paul
      Weiss has received significant backlash for their actions. The stark
      juxtaposition between it and Perkins Coie shows that their acquiescence is
      entirely optional, and evidence of their timidity and cowardice.
    </p>

    <h3>14238 – Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-20/pdf/2025-04868.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 14, 2025, published March 20, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 just says they want to reduce unnecessary Federal bureaucracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 eliminates the non-statutory and reduces to a minimum the
      statutory components and functions of
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFL5hLjeiWbzHNFpi-nEa_2_7Fd0nnvACDdoFiiQiuc/edit?tab=t.0"
        >these</a
      >
      federal entities.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      The effective closure of these various entities is very similar to those
      effectively closed entities in
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-25/pdf/2025-03133.pdf"
        >EO 14217</a
      >
      discussed in Weekly EO Report of 2/17/2025. These entities are ones that
      are tangentially tied to international partnerships and “progressive
      causes”.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      These agencies are almost entirely focused on helping the poor and
      underserved. The Administration will harvest a miniscule amount of funds
      for their own nefarious plans, meanwhile the communities and people these
      agencies served will suffer immensely. The goals of these agencies mostly
      boil down to provide small interventions in people’s lives that will
      result in long term positive effects. Education, housing, wealth, and just
      community cohesion all have benefitted immensely from these agencies, and
      without their support will degrade.
    </p>

    <h3>14239 – Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-21/pdf/2025-04973.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 18, 2025, published March 21, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 is mostly word salad about how intersectionality in emergency
      response is actually better than centralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 lays out a Federal policy that State and local governments and
      individuals are more central to emergency response and preparedness. It
      paradoxically then asks the Federal government to reduce complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 requires the review and recommendation for modification of
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2dS5q1BSoJFs0af38pBtFt9F_OSS47XfhR9mra-Bn4/edit?tab=t.0"
        >these</a
      >
      executive action.
    </p>

    <h4>What it Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is serving two purposes. First, it lays the groundwork for
      removing the obligations and duties of the Federal government to the
      states during times of national crisis. Second, it puts under review a
      number of significant executive actions that affect emergency preparedness
      for crises related to national security, natural disaster, economic
      instability, and public health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the previous EOs, this does not revoke these executive actions
      outright. Without going over each individually, the revocation of any one
      action listed could account for hundreds if not thousands of lives lost.
      Not only this, but the programs and institutions established through these
      executive actions allow for quicker recovery for victims of these crises
      and the national economy as a whole.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is one of many that we have seen and will see that aims to reduce
      the size of the government, and offload previously publicly absorbed
      costs, to the individual victims of local or regional crises. This is not
      in some kind of libertarian pursuit of small government, but an attempt at
      reducing expenses of the federal government. As expenses fall, the
      opportunity for corruption rises. Purchasing digital assets, making the
      secret service stay at Trump properties, and all other ways to pilfer
      public coffers are now that much more available to the Trump
      administration.

          <a href="#ref1">↑</a> It is important to note that the representation
          is for veterans and those in public service who otherwise would not
          have representation. While they either had already or likely would
          have offered this anyway, the firm, and Donald Trump, have presented
          this as a settlement and thus validated the executive action of
          extorting private firms.
