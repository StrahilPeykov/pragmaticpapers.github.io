      While I am a licensed attorney, this is not paid legal advice. Nothing in

    <h4><a id="_tddk6kkkgzhh"></a>1. Where we are at right now.</h4>
    <p>
      It is difficult to summarize the case of J.G.G. v. Donald Trump, in which
      five Venezuelans have sued to prevent their removal from the United
      States. There are many detailed and well written breakdowns of the events
      that happened prior to trial. The most relevant details are that over two
      hundred Venezuelans, allegedly members or associated with the Tren de
      Aragua gang, were detained and deported to an El Salvadorian prison by the
      US government. This was at the direction of President Trump, via the Alien
      Enemies Act (“AEA”) and his alleged war time powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five aforementioned plaintiffs, in a lightning fast filing, had their
      attorneys file Habeas petitions and claims of violations of their due
      process rights. They also attempted to claim a class of plaintiffs made up
      of all individuals detained under this action by the government. With this
      petition, the plaintiff’s sought a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), a
      rare form of judicial relief that allows a court to directly intervene
      between the parties to prevent irreparable harm to one or more party. The
      Court granted the TRO ordering the halt of any deportations of these
      individuals, then later expanded their order to recognize a potential
      class and prevent the deportation of all individuals detained under the
      AEA for 14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government, rather than follow the standard process, or show any form
      of professionalism, have tried every possible way to avoid making
      arguments in court and take the necessary steps to show their actions are
      legal. Further, there is nigh indisputable evidence that they have
      violated the TRO. The Court, aware of the potential violations, has held
      numerous hearings demanding evidence that its order was not violated. At
      and between these hearings, the government has refused to provide
      evidence, failed to answer direct questions from the judge, and shown open
      derision for the Court’s authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many have called for the Judge to level contempt, both criminal and civil,
      against the government attorneys. Others have said the attorneys involved
      should face personal sanctions and potential disbarment. Those sympathetic
      to the government instead claim that the judge is an activist and acting
      outside the bounds of his authority. According to the government, the
      Circuit Court should remove the Judge from the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article will attempt to better explain what TROs are, the judge’s
      options when trying to coerce the government into acting properly, and
      what options remain to resolve this constitutional crisis. While it is not
      comprehensive, it is a good start for a lay person to understand the
      process and procedures around this case. While an appeal has already been
      heard by the Circuit Court, and an appeal to the SCOTUS has been filed, I
      will not be discussing the arguments made, orders granted, and likelihood
      of success in these other courts.
    </p>
    <h4>
      <a id="_oylir08tm0sz"></a>2. TROs, what they are and when they’ve been
      ignored.
    </h4>
    <p>
      TROs are an extraordinary remedy granted by federal trial courts, almost
      always requested by a plaintiff, and almost always prior to the other
      party entering the lawsuit. It is an injunction, meaning an order by a
      court requiring or forbidding an action, to protect a party or the Court’s
      ability to hear a case. In plain terms, it is a court calling a timeout on
      some action it believes will create severe harm or make the case
      impossible to move forward. A TRO is one of the few times that a judge may
      have a hearing without both parties present, referred to as an ex-parte
      communication. Traditionally a TRO is only issued for 10 days, though may
      be extended another 10 upon request. A TRO is the explicit disregard of a
      party’s right to due process to the benefit of an opposing party. This
      means that it is granted sparingly, and only when irreparable harm is
      almost certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      TROs are a power created by statute,
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_65"
        >Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a
      >, with their final form Preliminary Injunctions. A Preliminary
      Injunction, unlike a TRO, can only be granted after a hearing with both
      parties. It requires a requesting party to show irreparable harm, that
      they are likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and that no public
      or private interests will be harmed more by the injunction than the
      requesting party would be if it weren’t granted. Preliminary Injunctions
      are not limited by a specific deadline, and considered less invasive than
      TROs. After the end of a TRO’s deadline, it automatically converts into a
      Preliminary Injunction, if no hearing is held by that time, the resulting
      Preliminary Injunction is able to be overturned by operation of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      TROs, and Preliminary Injunctions, are important aspects of the judicial
      system. They are employed to protect victims of domestic violence, halt
      hostile takeovers, and potentially throw up roadblocks to tyrannical
      regimes. Once granted, they <em>must</em> be followed, and violation of
      them opens a party to contempt, imprisonment, or even the dismissal of
      claims. A court’s power to compel a party to follow a TRO is surprisingly
      broad, and their power to punish a party for a later discovered violation
      equally so.

    <p>
      Contempt of Court is a term everyone has heard in the news, movies, and
      recently from democrat commentators regarding the government’s actions in
      court. In the federal court system, Contempt is divided into two
      categories: criminal and civil. Despite the names, they both can be issued
      during criminal and civil trials, and both can result in fines or
      imprisonment.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> A finding of
      Contempt is a power of a trial court to manage the cases and parties
      before them. Breaches of ethics, illegal actions, or even simple
      disrespect to the Court, can all result in Contempt against a party or
      their lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main qualities that distinguish Criminal and Civil Contempt.
      The first is when a court exercises them. Civil Contempt is used to compel
      behavior. Some examples would be if a party refuses to testify, fails to
      appear for a hearing, or refuses to follow a court order. Civil Contempt
      is often continuing until the party conforms to the desired behavior. For
      instance, if a party doesn’t conform to a court order, a court can levy a
      $1000 fine, which then doubles each day. Once the contemnor then conforms
      to the judgment, the fine no longer applies. In this way a Court can
      shepherd and manage parties who may try to take liberal interpretations to
      the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Criminal Contempt is generally used to punish a party’s previous behavior.
      A court is most likely to exercise this power when it is discovered that a
      party previously violated the rules, acted in a way to prejudice an
      opposing party, or undermined the Court’s ability to properly adjudicate a
      case. Criminal Contempt fines or imprisonment are not cured by a change of
      behavior, they are punishments. For instance, if a corporation dumped
      chemicals in violation of a Court order in an ongoing case, a Court can
      fine them equivalent to the damage caused by their violation, even if they
      have already stopped dumping in compliance with the order. In this way, if
      a party harms another or violates the rules, punishment can be used to
      discourage similar behavior in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second quality that distinguishes the two forms of Contempt is that
      Civil Contempt does not require a subsequent jury trial to levy any fine
      or imprisonment, while Criminal Contempt does. Criminal Contempt is, as
      the name suggests, a criminal charge and thus entitles the accused to a
      jury trial. The Department of Justice must represent the government as the
      prosecution at this second trial. Civil Contempt, meanwhile, only requires
      that a judge find that the order being defied was valid, clear, and that
      the contemnor had the ability to comply. This has led to some issues of
      judges leveling Civil Contempt rather than Criminal in order to avoid a
      jury trial. While no clear line has been drawn, appellate courts are wary
      of such behavior by trial judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      When contemptible actions are taken by a party’s lawyer rather than a
      party themselves, whether it is disrespect to the Court, arguing in bad
      faith, or clear ethics violations, there are further options a court has
      to punish or compel their behavior. A court can levy sanctions directly on
      an attorney, such sanctions can range from paying the opposing attorney’s
      fees, direct fines, or what are called “Death Penalty Sanctions”. Despite
      the scary name, Death Penalty Sanctions only mean that a case or
      counterclaim is dismissed for the egregious actions of the attorney, and
      are incredibly rare to see. Sanctions also are a matter of public record,
      and are reflected on the attorney’s publicly accessible profile on the
      relevant bar’s website. Sanctioned lawyers often suffer in finding
      employment and clients due to these public marks on their records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a judge can file a grievance with the relevant bar,<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
      against the attorney. These grievances can result in punishments by the
      bar of fines, suspension of license, or even disbarment. In almost all
      cases, a grievance that results in such punishments entitles the attorney
      to a hearing and adjudication. Grievances are usually reserved for actions
      directly involving the Court and ones that involve ethics violations.
    </p>
    <p>
      These powers are not mutually exclusive, a court can levy Criminal
      Contempt, Sanctions, and file a grievance for the same ethics violation.
      There are different reasons why a court may choose to exert some powers
      but not others, these decisions are intricate and can vary based on the
      judge employing them.
    </p>
    <h4>
      <a id="_b2pslbdy4j1y"></a>4. Judicial action in response to a defiant
      executive.
    </h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Returning to J.G.G. v. Trump, attorneys from the DOJ have refused to
      appear at hearings, refused to provide information requested by the Court,
      made bad faith arguments, and failed to comply with a clear and valid TRO.
      In any other case, and in any other administration, the Court would have
      fired off Contempt and sanctions at the first sign of defiance. Yet here
      we see silence from the bench. The Court has repeatedly set new hearings,
      and given the government more time to repair their grievous actions. While
      I am not interested in defending the Court’s inaction, I think it is worth
      discussing reasons why the Court has been so hesitant to punish the DOJ
      attorneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Criminal Contempt would be an appropriate punishment for the DOJ attorneys
      lying to the judge and defying the TRO preventing the government from
      deporting any further immigrants under the AEA. Had the Court leveled
      Criminal Contempt on the DOJ attorneys, it means the DOJ itself would then
      be required to investigate and prosecute their own attorney. The charged
      attorney was acting under the orders of the DOJ itself, so it is unlikely
      that the Contempt charge would be pursued. This means Criminal Contempt
      cannot punish the attorneys, and cannot then dissuade similar future
      behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civil Contempt, though it does not require a jury trial, can fail in a
      similar way. Should the Court order the incarceration of a DOJ attorney,
      the physical act of incarceration must be done via the US Marshals. The US
      Marshals are organized under the DOJ and thus the DOJ could just prevent
      the US Marshal service from then enforcing the Civil Contempt. Should the
      Court levy a Civil Contempt fine, whether compounding or single fee, the
      government would essentially be paying itself. A Court could instead levy
      Civil Contempt on the attorney individually, though the government could
      pay it on the attorney’s behalf. This again defeats the purpose of the
      Contempt and is unable to compel compliance with the TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the judge is almost certainly avoiding challenging the
      executive directly over a Contempt charge. Any direct challenge at this
      point is likely to bring the constitutional crisis between the Executive
      and Judiciary to a head. In the best reading of this court’s actions, the
      judge could be waiting for a more opportune time for such an ultimate
      conflict. This is not uncommon for courts to pick and choose the best case
      scenario for momentous decisions. As Contempt, even if successful, would
      not result in any significant change to the Executive’s egregious actions,
      or help the injured parties in this case, the Court may not wish to expend
      effort and time into such a fruitless endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanctions and Grievances against the individual attorneys are likely the
      best options for the judge, in this scenario. Sanctions and grievances
      against an attorney, whether they work for the DOJ or otherwise, can lead
      to disbarment. As we have
      <a
        href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-federal-prosecutor-ny-resigns-told-drop-adams-charges-rcna192030"
        >seen</a
      >, putting attorneys’ ability to practice in jeopardy for unethical or
      illegal filings has led to attorneys resigning from the DOJ. Should an
      attorney get disbarred in one district, it jeopardizes their licenses in
      all others. Additionally, these marks on their record make it difficult to
      get hired at jobs outside the DOJ, in the future. Should enough attorneys
      at the DOJ resign, it can seriously hamper the Executive’s ability to
      appear in court and enforce their policies.

    <p>
      Sanctions, bar licenses, evil people doing evil things being immune from
      consequences, how is this supposed to make you feel better? It isn’t, the
      reason it feels like this article is grasping at straws is because this is
      how a constitutional crisis feels. Our government is designed with good
      faith actors in mind, and should bad faith actors abuse the system, there
      are only a few checks and balances to try to right the ship. In this case,
      the Executive is acting in bad faith, they are not engaging with the rules
      and laws, and they know that they can undermine any Contempt leveled
      against their attorneys. Meanwhile the Judiciary is trying to act in good
      faith, follow the rules, and prevent the Executive’s actions from breaking
      the entire system.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this direct clash of these two branches, the Legislature should be
      stepping in to resolve the issue. Impeachment of an executive who is
      clearly intentionally trying to break the rules and disregard the
      institutions of our government is the solution to this problem. However,
      our congress will not act, and will not protect our system. While the
      judge in this case could take actions against the government, and, even if
      futile, at least show that they are defiant to this Administration’s
      abhorrent actions, their failure to do so is a red herring. The people
      abdicating their duty are the members of congress unwilling to stand up to
      an open authoritarian bent on destroying our government.
